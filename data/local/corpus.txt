I BELIEVE WE CAN HANDLE THIS OKAY
I BELIEVE WE HAVE A GOOD CHANCE
I BELIEVE YOU MAY BE THAT PERSON
I BOUGHT A CAR AT AUCTION
I BOUGHT A FLAT SIX YEARS AGO
I CALLED IT RIGHT
I CAME HERE THIS WEEK TO WORK
I CAME HOME BY AMBULANCE
I CAME INTO THIS WORLD WITH NOTHING
I CAME TO COMPLETE
I CAME UP THROUGH THE RANKS
I CAN ALMOST PRETEND TO BE SCOTTISH
I CAN APPEAR TO BE NICE AND LOVELY
I CAN ASSURE YOU THE NEW AUGUSTA NATIONAL IS EXACTLY THAT
I CAN CERTAINLY SEE MUCH BETTER
I CAN CONFIRM THAT MISS DEACON HAS RECEIVED A THREATENING PHONE CALL
I CAN DO THIS ON MY OWN
I CAN FEEL THE SOUND INSIDE
I CAN GIVE NO COMMENT
I CAN HANDLE THE PACE
I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT
I CAN LEAD BY EXAMPLE
I CAN LEAVE AT THE END OF THE DAY
I CAN LIVE WITH IT
I CAN LIVE WITH JUST THE ONE
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT
I CAN MAKE ONE FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENT
I CANNOT BELIEVE SHE HAS BEEN ADMONISHED
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE WOULD PAY SO MUCH FOR WORKS LIKE THESE
I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS DECISION
I CANNOT CONFIRM THE NAME OF ANY DRIVER
I CANNOT DESCRIBE IT
I CANNOT EXPLAIN THE GRIEF AND PAIN IN MY HEART
I CANNOT REALLY COMMIT
I CANNOT SAY ANYMORE
I CANNOT SAY TOO MUCH ABOUT THEM
I CANNOT SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE IRA
I CANNOT WAIT TO GET STARTED ON IT
I CAN SEE IT NOW
I CAN SEE THEIR ARGUMENT
I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE WOULD AGREE WITH IT
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT HAPPENED
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S ALL GONE
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE IS DEAD
I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE BUZZ
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE DIDN'T WIN THAT GAME
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT HAS HAPPENED
I CAN'T BLAME THE FANS
I CAN'T BLAME THE FANS FOR GETTING FRUSTRATED
I CAN'T DENY THAT FACT
I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING BEFORE NINE
I CAN TELL YOU LABOUR IS FIGHTING TO WIN
I CAN'T EVEN GET INTO THE A TEAM
I CAN'T GET A JOB
I CAN'T GET AWAY FROM IT
I CAN'T GET IT
I CAN'T PLAY THE GAME FOR THEM
I CAN'T REMEMBER A LOT ABOUT THE ACCIDENT
I CAN'T REMEMBER A LOT OF IT
I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING
I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ANY FIGURE
I CAN'T SAY THAT THIS IS VERY USUAL
I CAN'T SEE HIM REVERSING THAT
I CAN'T SEE MYSELF IN ONE OF THOSE
I CAN'T SPEAK FOR HIM
I CAN'T STAND THIS SORT OF STUFF
I CAN'T STOP PEOPLE THINKING
I CAN'T WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE OUTDOORS
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEASON TO END
I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HIM
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT
I CAN UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATIONS OF OUR FANS
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY HAVE GONE
I CARRIED ON FOR HIM
I CERTAINLY BELIEVE WE CAN DO IT
I CERTAINLY DO NOT AGREE WITH THAT
I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO
I CERTAINLY THINK IT SHOULD BE THERE
I CERTAINLY THINK IT'S VERY SHORT SIGHTED
I CERTAINLY WILL NOT SETTLE
I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT ACCEPT THIS DECISION
I CHOSE THE FORMER
I CHOSE TO GO BY THE RULES
I CHOSE TO MAKE A FILM
I COULD DO A BETTER JOB
I COULD EASY DO THAT
I COULD FEEL THE BLOOD ON MY FACE
I COULD GO ON BUT NONE OF THESE THINGS IS TRUE
I COULD HARDLY KEEP UP WITH PROFESSOR MCKEAN
I COULD HARDLY MOVE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS
I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED ON THAT DAY
I COULD HAVE BEEN OFFENDED
I COULD HAVE GOT OUT A LONG TIME AGO
I COULD LIVE WITHOUT THE ATTENTION HE ADMITTED
I COULD NEVER BE COOL
I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT
I COULD NOT BELIEVE THE RESULTS
I COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY WERE SAYING
I COULD NOT DO IT
I COULD NOT HAVE HOPED TO RUN AT THIS LEVEL
I COULD NOT LIVE WITH IT
I COULD NOT SIT IN THE STANDS
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S TRUE
I COULDN'T GET OUT OF BED
I COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR BETTER
I COULDN'T HONESTLY TELL YOU
I COULDN'T MAKE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON
I COULDN'T PUT MY FINGER ON IT
I COULDN'T QUITE BELIEVE IT AND STILL CAN'T
I COULDN'T REALLY WORK OUTSIDE EDINBURGH
I COULDN'T SEE ANY REASON NOT TO DIE
I COULD SEE HIS DESIRE FOR THE JOB IN HIS EYES
I COULD TELL THAT ALASTAIR WILKIE WAS ENERGISED
I'D ALWAYS WANTED TO ACT
I'D BEEN OUT WITH MY GIRLFRIEND AND WE WERE ATTACKED
I'D COME BACK FROM LONDON
I DECIDED IT IS GOING TO BE WILLIAM
I DECIDED NOT TO RENEW THE CONTRACT
I DECIDED TO TAKE MY TIME
I DECIDED TO TELL A BIT OF THE STORY ABOUT MYSELF
I'D GO ANYWHERE TO WORK SO LONG AS IT'S WORTH IT

I DID NOT CONCENTRATE ON MY PERFORMANCE
I DID NOT GO LOOKING ANYWHERE ELSE
I DID NOT HAVE A BET ON MYSELF
I DID NOT HAVE FAITH IN THE PROCEDURES
I DID NOT NAME IT
I DID NOT SEE ANY REASON TO CHANGE THE CAPTAIN
I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING TO BEGIN WITH
I DID NOT THINK ABOUT THE RYDER CUP
I DID NOT THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER
I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF SCOTLAND

I DIDN'T NEED TO WATCH IT ON THE VIDEO
I DIDN'T PLAY ALL THAT WELL
I DIDN'T PLAY BADLY
I DIDN'T PLAY TOO WELL IN THE THIRD QUARTER

I DIDN'T REALISE IT HAD REACHED THAT STAGE
I DIDN'T REALLY EXPECT TO BE CALLED UP
I DIDN'T SEE IT

I DIDN'T THINK ANY PLAYER WAS A SUCCESS ON SATURDAY
I DIDN'T THINK SO EITHER
I DIDN'T THINK THEY WOULD BE THAT STUPID
I DIDN'T THINK WE DESERVED TO GO OUT

I'D SIGN BACK UP TOMORROW IF HE WAS BACK ON BOARD
I ENJOYED MY WORK IN THE SCOTTISH OFFICE
I ENJOY MY WORK
I ENJOY PLAYING WITH BOTH OF THEM
I ENJOY THE CREATIVE PROCESS
I EXPECT A RAPID RESPONSE
I EXPECTED A VICTORY THE PAIN IS ENORMOUS
I EXPECTED THESE KIND OF QUESTIONS
IF A SERVICE DOESN'T PAY IT WILL GO
IF CONVICTED THEY FACE THE DEATH PENALTY
I FEEL A LITTLE BETRAYED
I FEEL ALIVE AND GOOD TODAY
I FEEL AS IF I CAN HOLE EVERYTHING NOW
I FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT THE OUTCOME
I FEEL I DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME
I FEEL IT IS VERY IRRATIONAL
I FEEL IT'S TIME TO MAKE THE SWITCH

I FEEL SORRY FOR ANYONE COMING IN HERE
I FEEL SORRY FOR THE REDS
I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT IT
I FEEL VERY GRATEFUL WITH EVERYTHING
I FEEL VERY SAD AND EXTREMELY CUT UP
I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THAT
I FEEL WE MIGHT NOW HAVE THE FOUNDATIONS TO GO FORWARD
I FELL AGAINST HIM
I FELL IN LOVE WITH BALLET
I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT
I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT RIGHT AWAY
I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE BALLET
I FELL INTO IT BY ACCIDENT
I FELL TO THE GROUND
I FELT ABOUT THIS BIG
I FELT HE WAS EXCELLENT
I FELT IT WAS TIME FOR ME TO LEAVE TO DEVELOP MY CAREER
I FELT LIKE I WAS A CHILD
I FELT REALLY GOOD UNTIL FRIDAY
I FELT THE HEAD WAS VERY LIKE ME
I FELT UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE
I FELT UNDER NO PRESSURE TODAY
I FELT VERY STRONGLY THAT ENGLAND SHOULD HAVE IT
I FELT WE DESERVED THE THREE POINTS
I FELT WE HAD FALLEN BACK A LITTLE
I FELT WE NEEDED TO BRING THAT IN
I FELT WE PLAYED SOME EXCELLENT FOOTBALL IN THE FIRST HALF
IF GLASGOW IS SO INTERESTED THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BID
IF HE COULD HAVE PREVENTED IT HAPPENING HE WOULD HAVE
IF HE COULD'VE PREVENTED IT HAPPENING HE WOULD HAVE
IF HE DOES HE HAS A REAL CHANCE OF GOLD
IF HE DOES NOT LEAVE HE WILL BE SHOT
IF HE LEAVES THE BAND IS FINISHED
IF HE SAW SOMEBODY IN TROUBLE HE WOULD TRY TO HELP
IF I DIDN'T GO FOR THE WORLD RECORD I'D FEEL GUILTY
I FIND IT PUZZLING AND DISTURBING
I FIND IT RATHER OPPRESSIVE
I FIND THE WHOLE AFFAIR DISTURBING
I FIND THIS ONGOING DEBATE IS DEMEANING
I FIRST MET HIM LAST SUMMER
IF IT DOES IT MEANS HE HAS FAILED
IF IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T
IF IT'S GOING IN IT GOES IN
IF IT'S NOT THEY DIDN'T GO FAR ENOUGH
IF IT WASN'T SO PATHETIC IT WOULD BE FUNNY
IF I WAS A WOMAN
IF NOT A DEAL COULD TAKE MANY MONTHS
IF NOT HE SHOULD GO HOME
IF ONLY HE KNEW HIMSELF
IF ONLY IT HAD BEEN
IF ONLY IT WERE SO
IF ONLY THE ACTING PROFESSION WAS THAT SIMPLE
IF ONLY THE PROBLEMS CONCERNED THE PLAYERS
IF ONLY WE HAD KNOWN
I FOOLISHLY HAD DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT
I FOUND A FAULT AND IT WORKED AT IT
I FOUND A FAULT AND WORKED AT IT
I FOUND THAT MUCH MORE CHALLENGING
I FOUND THAT WE COULDN'T
I FOUND THE COURSE INSPIRING
IF PEOPLE ARE GENUINE THEN THE PROBLEM IS NOT OSAMA BIN LADEN
IF SO HOW DOES IT INTEND TO ACHIEVE THIS RESULT
IF SO IT IS A FUNNY TIME TO INTRODUCE IT
IF SO THEY WERE WRONG
IF SO WE WANT TO HEAR FROM THEM
IF SUCCESSFUL SEVERAL RECORDS WILL BE MADE
IF THAT IS NOT A WARNING WHAT IS IT
IF THAT IS THE CASE IT IS A BREAKTHROUGH
IF THAT IS THE PERCEPTION THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED
IF THAT'S THE CASE HE WILL STRUGGLE
IF THE DIRECTOR IS WITH YOU
IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORMS YELLOW
IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN YELLOW LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
IF THERE IS DEFAULT
IF THEY ARE NOT THE COMMISSION WILL TAKE ACTION
IF THEY DON'T THEY CAN EXPECT THEIR FUNDING TO BE CUT
IF THEY DON'T THEY MIGHT WELL DECIDE NOT TO PLAY
IF THEY DON'T THEY SHOULD SAY SO
IF THEY DON'T THEY WON'T GET WHAT THEY WANT
IF THEY DON'T WANT TO READ IT THEY DON'T HAVE TO
IF THEY GAVE ME FREE ELECTRICITY I STILL WOULDN'T SUPPORT THE PLANS
IF THEY HAVE CITY BACKING WHAT IS THE INFLUENCE
IF THEY LIKED IT THEN I'LL BE HAPPY
IF THEY WISH TO GO THEY CAN GO
IF TRUE IT WILL BE THE FIRST SIGN OF DISSENT
IF WE CANNOT SUCCEED IN THIS ENDEAVOUR THEN SO BE IT
IF WE DON'T DO IT SOMEONE ELSE WILL
IF WE GET A PENALTY NEXT WEEK I WANT TO TAKE IT
IF WE GET THE WRONG CANDIDATE
IF WE LIVE FOREVER CAN WE BE SAID TO LIVE
IF WE LIVE FOREVER CAN WE REALLY BE SAID TO LIVE
IF WE LOSE THE DOCTOR IT WOULD BE THE LAST STRAW
IF WE WERE OFFERED THE SCOTSMAN I WOULD BUY IT
IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE BLUE AND WHITE
IF YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH IT YOU DO IT
IF YOU CAN GET IT
IF YOU CAN MAKE IT THERE YOU CAN MAKE IT ANYWHERE
IF YOU CAN RUN A COMPUTER YOU CAN TALK TO THE WORLD
IF YOU CAN WORK YOU SHOULD WORK
IF YOU COULD FIND IT
IF YOU COULD HAVE DINNER WITH ANYONE WHO WOULD IT BE
IF YOU DON'T ENFORCE IT YOU BRING IT INTO DISREPUTE
IF YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR TREATMENT YOU PAY FOR TREATMENT
IF YOU LOOK AT THE BEGINNING OF ALIEN
IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER GALLERIES IN THIS AREA
IF YOU'RE A NATIONAL COMPANY YOU MUST PROVIDE IT ALL
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT DO IT RIGHT
I GAVE HIM A WAY OUT AND HE TOOK IT

I'M AFRAID TO SAY ANYTHING
I'M A LITTLE BIT TIRED
I'M AMAZED AT WHAT HE'S DONE
I MANAGED TO DO THAT
I MANAGED TO TAKE HER COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE
I'M AS FIT AS I CAN GET
I'M A SOLDIER A SOLDIER A SOLDIER
I'M ASTONISHED BY THIS DECISION
I'M ASTONISHED THE MEN WERE NOT INJURED
I'M AWARE THAT SOMEBODY MADE A THREAT

I'M CERTAINLY THINKING ABOUT RETIREMENT
I'M CONFIDENT OF THE OUTCOME THIS WEEK

I MIGHT GET AN INJURY VERY EASILY
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN SITTING AT HOME WITH HER OUT HERE
I MIGHT WELL HAVE DONE SO ALREADY
I'M INTERESTED IN ALL KINDS OF HISTORY
I'M INTERESTED IN INTERESTING WORK
I MISS THE FREEDOM THAT I HAD

IMMEDIATE ACTION MUST BE TAKEN
I'M NOT A DIVA
I'M NOT A FAN OF BOOKS
I'M NOT AFRAID OF THAT
I'M NOT A LITTLE GIRL
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SAY THAT OF COURSE
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SPEAK TO ANYONE
I'M NOT A MAGICIAN
I'M NOT A PAEDOPHILE
I'M NOT A THREAT TO COACHES
I'M NOT BLAMING AUDIENCES
I'M NOT CHANGING MY MIND
I'M NOT DEPRESSED
I'M NOT FIT FOR ANYTHING ELSE
I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER THAT RIGHT NOW
I'M NOT GOING TO BLAME THE BAND
I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE FROM IT
I'M NOT GOING TO GET UPSET BY TWO COMEDY PROMOTERS
I'M NOT HOLDING THE CLUB TO RANSOM
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN COMING UP WITH ANSWERS
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN MONEY
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THE JOB
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A BREAKTHROUGH
I'M NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO IT
I'M NOT MAKING ANY COMMENT AT ALL
I'M NOT MAKING ANY SPECIFIC ATTEMPT ON THE WORLD RECORD
I'M NOT PUTTING MYSELF DOWN
I'M NOT SAYING HE IS FINISHED
I'M NOT SURE
I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY GOT THERE BUT THEY ARE
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S RIGHT
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT HIS CAREER
I'M NOT THERE YET BUT IT IS CLOSE
I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT ANYONE ELSE
I'M NOT THINKING TOO MUCH ABOUT THE TOUR
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE CRITICS
I'M PLEASED ABOUT ONE THING
I'M PLEASED FOR HIM
I'M PLEASED TO GET THROUGH THE OPENING MATCH
I'M PLEASED WITH SOME ASPECTS OF THE PERFORMANCE
I'M PLEASED WITH THE HORSE
I'M PRETTY HAPPY WITH THE WAY I PLAYED
I'M QUITE EMBARRASSED AND ASHAMED OF DOING THAT
I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE ALBUM
I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH HOW THINGS WENT THERE
I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH THE WAY IT WENT
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE FIGHT
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT

I'M SO HAPPY THAT SHE DID
I'M SO LOOKING FORWARD TO IT
I'M SO PLEASED THE SHOW HAS WON A PRIZE
I'M SO PROUD OF MY TEAM
I'M SO PROUD TO BE SCOTTISH TONIGHT
I'M SORRY IF ANY OFFENCE HAS BEEN CAUSED
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THIS NEWS
I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT THE ROADS
I'M STILL AN AMATEUR IN THAT SENSE
I'M SURE EVERYONE WILL BE DELIGHTED FOR THEM
I'M SURE HE DIDN'T MEAN IT
I'M SURE HE DOES
I'M SURE HE WILL BE AWARE OF IT
I'M SURE HE WOULD LOVE IT
I'M SURE IT WILL GO ON
I'M SURE THAT CLUBS WILL ALL BE DELIGHTED
I'M SURE THAT IS NOT
I'M SURE THAT THEY WILL LEARN
I'M SURE THEY LOVE IT
I'M SURE THEY WILL BE VERY HAPPY
I'M SURE THIS GAME WILL BE EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL
I'M SURE YOU ALL CAN RELATE TO THAT
I'M SURPRISED THAT IT HAS TAKEN THIS APPROACH
I'M SURPRISED TO HEAR IT FROM TONY
I'M TAKING EACH DAY AS IT COMES
I'M THE ONE THAT SAID IT
I'M THE ONE WHO HAS TO SUFFER
I'M THINKING WHAT WOULD BE EASIER
I'M TOTALLY HORRIFIED BY THE SENTENCE
I'M TRYING NOT TO THINK ABOUT THAT
I'M TRYING TO BE RELAXED ABOUT THE FUTURE
I'M TRYING TO STAY OPEN ON THAT
I MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
I MUST MAKE THAT CLEAR
I MUST TAKE A SEAT
I'M VERY ANGRY ABOUT IT
I'M VERY FRIGHTENED OF THE DARK
I'M VERY GRATEFUL
I'M VERY HAPPY INDEED TO BE ALMOST REDUNDANT
I'M VERY HAPPY THAT IT EXPLODED
I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE
I'M VERY HAPPY TONIGHT
I'M VERY LUCKY
I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT MY COUNTRY
I'M VERY PLEASED FOR THE CLUB AND FOR MYSELF
I'M VERY PLEASED WITH WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED
I'M VERY PUZZLED BY IT
I'M VERY RELAXED ABOUT THAT INDEED
I'M VERY RELIEVED THAT I HAVE FINALLY WON
I'M VERY SAD AND DEEPLY SHOCKED
I'M VERY SURPRISED AND OBVIOUSLY DELIGHTED
I'M VERY TIRED BUT IT WAS WORTH IT
I'M WONDERING WHAT YOU FEEL ABOUT THE YOUNGEST
I'M WORKING AT THE MOMENT
I'M WORKING ON THAT
I'M WORKING ON THAT ONE TOO
IN ADDITION CERTAIN AREAS ARE CLOSED AT CERTAIN TIMES
IN ADDITION CERTAIN AREAS CLOSED AT CERTAIN TIMES
IN ADDITION INVESTOR CHOICE IS REDUCED
IN ADDITION IT WAS IN BREACH OF NATURAL JUSTICE
IN ADDITION IT WAS JUST A BREACH OF NATURAL JUSTICE
IN ADDITION MARGINS HAVE BEEN MAINTAINED
IN ALL CASES COMPUTER EQUIPMENT WAS SEIZED
IN A WAY HE WAS
IN BOTH CASES I SUFFERED A FIASCO
INCLUSION AND AUTISM IS IT WORKING
INDEED HE DOES
INDEED HE HAS A LOT OF OUTPUT
INDEED HE SEES A SHORTAGE OF SKILLED WORKERS ON THE HORIZON
INDEED IT IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
INDEED IT WAS MAGICAL
INDEED THAT HAS ALREADY BEGUN
IN DUE COURSE THE DEAL WAS DONE
IN DUE COURSE WE WILL MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT
INDUSTRIAL ACTION HAS TO HURT
INDUSTRY LEADERS REACTED ANGRILY
IN EACH CASE THEY WERE A GOAL DOWN
I NEED A PUBLISHING DEAL
I NEEDED A CHANGE A NEW CHALLENGE
I NEEDED A LITTLE MAN IN THE CROWD
I NEEDED TO GET AWAY
I NEED THEM TO SET MY CAREER
IN ESSENCE THE TEACHING PROFESSION HAS A CHOICE
IN EUROPE IT IS ALWAYS OVER TWO GAMES
I NEVER AGREED WITH THAT
I NEVER FOUND MY RHYTHM
I NEVER GOT ANYTHING OUT OF IT
I NEVER HAD A CHILDHOOD
I NEVER HAD ANY CONFIDENCE IN IT AFTERWARDS
I NEVER HAD ANY REAL DIRECTION AT SCHOOL
I NEVER MADE ANY OFFER TO MARK
I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD TAKE THIS LONG
I NEVER WANTED A LEGAL BATTLE
I NEVER WANT TO HAVE ANY CHILDREN
I NEVER WON A PENNY THROUGHOUT MY CAREER
IN FACT HE DIDN'T DELIVER A SPEECH AT THE AWARDS
IN FACT HE IS NOT EVEN IN THE SQUAD FOR THE GAME
IN FACT HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THE FIELD
IN FACT HE TOOK IT VERY WELL
IN FACT HE WAS GREAT TODAY
IN FACT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE SURVIVAL BUSINESS
IN FACT I HAVE BEEN A BIT OF A TERRORIST TO THE COUNCIL
IN FACT I HAVE EVEN HAD A BET ON THEM
IN FACT IT IS DEEPLY UNPLEASANT
IN FACT IT ISN'T RELATED TO EITHER
IN FACT IT MIGHT JUST BE BEGINNING
IN FACT IT MIGHT JUST BE THE BEGINNING
IN FACT IT WAS ALMOST AS IF IT WAS EXPECTED
IN FACT IT WAS GEOFFREY ROBINSON
IN FACT THAT WOULD BE A DISTORTION OF THE TRUTH
IN FACT THE REASONS ARE SIMPLE
IN FACT THEY ARE THE FUTURE OF INVESTMENT
IN FACT THEY GO HAND IN HAND
IN FACT THEY HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT
IN FACT THEY SHOULD HAVE SCORED THREE TIMES
IN FACT THEY WILL NOT BE DISCIPLINED
IN FACT WE WERE ALL OVER THE SHOP
IN FOOTBALL IT IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE
IN FRANCE THE REVERSE IS TRUE
IN GENERAL TERMS THE PROPOSALS ARE VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS
IN GLASGOW A SHERIFF DISMISSED FIVE CASES YESTERDAY WITHOUT HEARING EVIDENCE
IN GREAT BRITAIN IT HAS A LIFE OF ITS OWN
IN HER OPINION THE RICH ARE DIFFERENT
IN HINDSIGHT IT WAS THE WRONG DECISION
IN HIS ABSENCE THE COUNCIL ADOPTED THE CHANGE
IN HIS NEW CABINET ROLE AS PARTY CHAIRMAN IT WILL BECOME HIS PRIMARY TASK
INITIAL MARKET REACTION WAS CLOSE TO EUPHORIC
INITIAL REPORTS SAID THE AIRCRAFT HAD EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF POWER
IN IT WENT
INJURIES HAVE TAKEN THEIR TOLL
INJURY HAS PLAYED A PART BUT NOT A BIG ONE
IN JUST A FORTNIGHT HOWEVER EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED
IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS THE WOMEN HAVE ACHIEVED A LOT
IN LIGHT OF THINGS I THINK I MADE THE RIGHT DECISION
IN LONDON TODAY IT WAS BUSINESS AS USUAL
IN MANY WAYS IT WAS DISASTROUS
IN MANY WAYS THAT IS AS IMPORTANT
IN MY EXPERIENCE HE DOES NOT DO THAT
IN MY OPINION ANY TRANSFER TO A FOREIGN CLUB WILL HELP HIM PROGRESS
IN MY OPINION IT WAS A MISTAKE AND NEVER ON PURPOSE
IN MY OPINION IT WAS NOT WORKING PERFECTLY
IN MY VIEW IT HAS TO BE DONE
INNOCENT PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO LIVE IN SAFETY
IN ORDER TO GET THERE WE HAVE GOT TO INVEST
I NOW KNOW THAT FROM MEMORY
IN PART THAT REFLECTED THE TIMES
IN PERFORMANCE THAT QUALITY CAN PROVE TO BE A CHALLENGE
IN PRACTICE THE ECONOMIC TESTS HAVE TO BE MET
INQUIRIES ARE ONGOING INTO THIS INCIDENT
INQUIRIES ARE STILL IN AN EARLY STAGE
IN SAYING THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO GET ON WITH IT
IN SCOTLAND THERE SHOULD BE VIGILANCE
IN SCOTLAND WE KEEP THE FAITH
IN SHORT THE CLUB WAS BROKE
IN SHORT THE NATIONAL TEAM WITHOUT FRANK IS LIKE FOOTBALL WITHOUT FEET
IN SHORT THE SCOTTISH EXCESS IS NOT DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY
INSIDE THE ATMOSPHERE WAS QUIET
INSIDE THERE IS A KIND OF MADNESS
IN SOME CASES THE NATION SHOULD BE GRATEFUL
INSPECTIONS ARE NOT THE PROBLEM
INSPIRING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IS CRUCIAL
IN SPITE OF RECENT ADVANCES THE LANGUAGE IS STILL UNDER THREAT
INSTEAD ANOTHER DEPRESSION CAME IN
INSTEAD HE MISSED THE LOT
INSTEAD HE WAS INFORMED TO JOIN THE LINE OF CREDITORS
INSTEAD IT IS BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD
INSTEAD IT'S BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD
INSTEAD SHE JUST WENT AWAY
INSTEAD THEY WERE OPENLY ATTEMPTING TO BE HELPFUL
INSTEAD WE MAKE THE GROUND PAY
INSTEAD WE WERE SHOT IN THE BACK
INSURANCE WILL BE COVERED BY THE RECEIVING GALLERIES
INSURANCE WILL PERHAPS REDUCE
INTENSIVE CARE HAS BEEN VERY BUSY
INTERNET USERS WILL DOUBLE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS IN THE UK
IN THAT CASE THE CHILDREN WERE NOT MISSING
IN THAT CASE WE WOULD BE PREPARED TO DEFEND OURSELVES
IN THAT MOMENT I WAS HAPPY
IN THAT SITUATION THEY THOUGHT WE SHOULD BE BEATEN
IN THE CURRENT OUTBREAK THE REVERSE IS TRUE
IN THE EARLY DAYS I WAS OBSESSED WITH WORKING IN THE THEATRE
IN THE END HOWEVER IT ALL CAME TOGETHER
IN THE END IT WAS NO CHOICE
IN THE END IT WILL MEAN AN AWFUL LOT
IN THE END THAT WAS ENOUGH TO BEAT ENGLAND
IN THE END WE DID NOT SPEND A PENNY ON HIM
IN THE END WE HAVE TO TAKE A STAND
IN THE END WE MADE TOO MANY ERRORS
IN THE EVENT IT PROVED A LARGELY UPLIFTING EXPERIENCE
IN THE EYES OF THE SUPPORTERS THERE HAS BEEN A BETRAYAL
IN THE MEANTIME EVERYONE IS TAKING EVERYONE TO COURT
IN THE MEANTIME HE ADDED PREVENTION WAS THE KEY
IN THE MEANTIME THE FANS WOULD SETTLE FOR A DERBY WIN
IN THE MEANTIME YOU JUST HAVE TO GET ON WITH IT
IN THE OLD DAYS IT WAS EASY
IN THE PAST FEW YEARS THEY HAVE STARTED TO FIGHT BACK
IN THE UK INFLATION DATA WILL BE PUBLISHED THIS MORNING
IN THIS CASE THE FARMER HAD ACTUALLY GIVEN PERMISSION
IN TIME MAY PROVE A WORTHY SUCCESSOR TO BILLY DODDS
IN TIME THE FIRST MINISTER WILL GROW IN STATURE
INVENTORIES ARE COMING UNDER CONTROL
INVESTMENT IN QUALITY SERVICE AND MARKETING WERE THE ONLY WAY FORWARD
INVESTORS CAN BE FORGIVEN FOR CAUTION
INVESTORS WERE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT MARGIN PRESSURE
I ONLY FOUND OUT ABOUT IT THIS MORNING
I ONLY HALF BELIEVED IT
I ONLY HALF BELIEVE IT
I ONLY SIGNED THIS MORNING
I ONLY WANTED TO GIVE HER A FRIGHT
I PLAYED BADLY BUT IT HAPPENS
I PLAYED REALLY WELL ON THE BACK NINE
I PLAYED WELL BUT MISSED A FEW CHANCES
I PLAYED WELL IN MY TIME THERE
I PLAYED WELL ON SATURDAY AND AGAIN TODAY
I PREFER THE CLARITY OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A DANCER
I PUT PRESSURE ON HIM
I PUT THE DRAWING DOWN
I RAN TO GET OUT OF THE WAY
IRAQ HAS NO INTEREST IN WAR
I READ ABOUT IT IN THE NEWSPAPERS
I READ IT EVERY YEAR
I REALISED I WAS LUCKY TO HAVE IT
I REALLY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT HAD ACTUALLY HAPPENED
I REALLY DIDN'T THINK HE WOULD
I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING
I REALLY FEEL SORRY FOR THE IRISH
I REALLY HAD TO CONCENTRATE
I REALLY HAVE TO GO NOW
I REALLY HOPE HE THINKS THAT THROUGH
I REALLY WANT TO WIN IN GLASGOW
I RECKON HE WON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE AGAIN
I RECOMMEND A TOUR
I REJECTED THE IDEA OF A SEPARATE RESIDENCE
IRELAND IS ALSO PREPARED TO TAKE IN REFUGEES
I REMAIN A BUYER OF THE SHARES
I REMEMBER IT CLEARLY
I REMEMBER THAT DAY WELL
I REMINDED MYSELF THAT WE WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT A DEATH
I REPORTED IT BUT NOTHING WAS DONE
IRVINE SAID HIS COMPANY WAS INTENT ON SUPPORTING THE SCOTTISH DAIRY INDUSTRY
IS A DRUG DEALER
I SAID AT THE TIME IT WAS WRONG
I SAID HE WAS SET TO RETIRE
I SAID HOW MUCH
I SAID SHE WAS VERY YOUNG
I SAID THAT I HAD BEEN RAPED
I SAID TO HIM
I SAID WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
I SAID WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT
I SAW A LOT OF GOOD THINGS AGAINST LIVINGSTON
I SAW IT AT A RUCK
I SAW IT DIDN'T WORK
I SAW IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY
I SAW IT LATER IN THE NEWS
I SAW MILITARY VEHICLES IN THE DISTANCE
I SAW ONE BODY
I SAW ONE MAN VOTE FIVE TIMES
I SAW PEOPLE ON FIRE
I SAW SOME GOOD THINGS
I SAW SOME TERRIBLE THINGS
I SAW THE EXPLOSION AND PANICKED
I SAW THEM LAST WEEK
I SAW THEM NOT LONG AFTER IT HAPPENED
I SAW THE OTHER CAR COMING BUT COULD DO NOTHING
I SAW THE STORY BUT THAT AMOUNT WOULDN'T EVEN PAY MY COMMISSION
I SAW THE WHOLE THING
IS BEING NATURALLY FUNNY ENOUGH
I SEE IT AS MY JOB
I SEEM TO KEEP THIS FOR THE MAJORS
I SEE NO NEED FOR CHANGE
I SEE NO NEED TO CHANGE
I SEE NO REASON FOR THEM TO BE
I SEE NO REASON TO DOUBT THAT THE SITUATION IN SCOTLAND IS ANY DIFFERENT
I SEE NO REASON TO HAVE THIS DEBATE AT THIS TIME
I SEE SOCIAL WORK AS A VOCATION A COMMITMENT
I SEE THAT ANY DAY NOW
I SEE THE EXTENDED FAMILY ONCE A YEAR
I SHALL BE VOTING YES TO SUPPORT HIM
IS HE ANY GOOD
IS HE ANY GOOD IN THE KITCHEN
IS HE CONSCIOUS
IS HE GOING TO LOOK AFTER THEM
I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM ONE IN RETURN
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE COME OVER TO FIFE
I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO STAND
I SHOULDN'T HAVE PUT UP WITH IT
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH IT
I SHOULD SAY SO
I SHOULD THINK SO TOO
I SINCERELY HOPE NOT
I SINCERELY HOPE THAT WILL NOT CHANGE
IS IT ALL REAL
IS IT ANY GOOD
I SIT AT HOME A LOT
IS IT A THREAT TO UNION
IS IT A WARNING TO PARENTS
I SIT IN THE CAR
IS IT IN THE RIGHT PLACE
IS IT IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
IS IT ON A BUILDING SITE
IS IT THE FLIGHT
IS IT THE PLAYERS OR IS IT THE COACHES
IS IT THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME
IS IT WORTH IT
IS IT WORTH IT 
IS MY WIFE A RACIST
IS OUR CHILDREN LEARNING
IS OUR CHILDREN LEARNING 
I SPOKE TO HIM YESTERDAY
I SPOKE WITH JUST ONE PLAYER BUT NOT THE OTHERS
ISRAEL HAS DONE VERY LITTLE UNTIL NOW
ISRAELI FORCES DENIED THE CLAIM
IS SADDAM A THREAT
IS SHE IN TROUBLE
IS SOMETHING WHICH WE JUST DON'T DO
I STARTED IT BUT THEN FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT
I STARTED ON A FIRE A COUPLE OF TIMES
I STARTED ON FIRE A COUPLE OF TIMES
I STAYED AWAY FROM THE DEFENCE
IS THAT AN ISSUE
IS THAT A SERIOUS QUESTION
IS THAT IT
IS THAT NOT PATHETIC
IS THAT NOT UNCANNY
IS THAT POSSIBLE
IS THAT RIGHT
IS THAT SUCCESS
IS THAT SUCH A BAD THING
IS THAT TITANIC
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK
IS THAT WHAT IT'S ABOUT
IS THAT WHAT PEOPLE WANT
IS THAT WHAT PEOPLE WE WANT
IS THAT WHERE WE ARE
IS THERE A NEW WAY FORWARD
IS THERE ANY PROSPECT OF THIS HAPPENING
IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE WOUND
IS THERE A WAITING LIST
IS THERE A WAITING LIST 
IS THERE ON HIS HANDS
IS THE WAR OVER
IS THE WELSH ASSEMBLY GOING TO GO
IS THIS ACCURATE
IS THIS NEW REPORT THE ANSWER
I STILL FEEL LIKE A WEE BOY
I STILL HOPE TO GO
I STILL THINK HE WILL WIN
IS TONY BLAIR ON DRUGS
I SUGGEST A NEW PLAN
I SUPPORT THE STAND THAT THEY ARE MAKING
I SUPPOSE IT IS QUITE EXCITING REALLY
I SUSPECT THAT IT WILL
I SUSPECT THE LATTER
IS YOUR LIFE A LITTLE TOO EASY
IT ADDED TO THE REVERENCE
IT ADDED TO THE SPECTACLE
IT AIMS TO PRODUCE ITS REPORT BEFORE CHRISTMAS
IT ALL BEGAN AS AN ACCIDENT
IT ALL CAME GOOD
IT ALL CHANGES FOR HER
IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE CHANCELLOR
IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE WIND
IT ALL HAPPENED SO QUICKLY
IT ALL HAPPENED SO SUDDENLY
IT ALL SEEMED SO EASY
IT ALL STARTED WITH A VISITING RUGBY CLUB
IT ALMOST CERTAINLY IS
IT ALSO CALLS FOR LICENSING OF COLLECTION CENTRES
IT ALSO CONDEMNED THE SUICIDE BOMBERS
IT ALSO HAS A GOOD LABOUR SUPPLY
IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTED SOME LOCAL HERO DISTRICTS
IT ALSO INDICATED THAT HER CONDITION HAD DETERIORATED
IT ALSO MAKES A HABIT OF COLLECTING PEOPLE
IT ALSO MAKES FOR INTERESTING VIEWING
IT ALSO OPENED A BRANCH IN LIVINGSTON
IT ALSO PROVIDES A WEALTH OF CONTRAST WITHIN THE MOVEMENT
IT ALWAYS HAD TO BE ABOUT THE GYM
ITALY IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE
ITALY WAS JUST BEHIND THE US
ITALY WOULD BE LUKEWARM
IT APPEARS THAT IT WAS JUST A GENUINE MISTAKE
IT APPEARS THAT NO HOLIDAY IS COMPLETE WITHOUT A GOOD ROW
IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN CLOSED DOWN
IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL
IT ATTRACTED NO COMPLAINTS
IT BECAME A BOOK BY ITSELF
IT BECAME A NATIONAL NETWORK
IT BECAME DIFFICULT FOR ME
IT BEING THE WEEKEND THERE WAS NO ONE THERE
IT BENEFITS THE WHOLE FAMILY
IT BRINGS TOGETHER TWO ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS
IT BROKE UP MY MARRIAGE
IT BROUGHT IN NEW MANAGEMENT
IT CAME A BIT LATE
IT CAME AS A SURPRISE
IT CAME AS A SURPRISE BECAUSE MY JOB IS TO GO BACKWARDS
IT CAME IN BITS AND PIECES
IT CAN ALL BE DONE OVER THE PHONE
IT CAN BE FRIGHTENING
IT CAN BE HALTED
IT CAN BE VERY WORRYING
IT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE
IT CAN HELP
IT CAN TAKE A LONG TIME
IT CAN'T JUST BE A CYNICAL MARKETING EXERCISE
IT CARRIED A DOUBLE MESSAGE
IT CARRIES A DOUBLE MESSAGE
IT CAUSED A LOT OF UPSET
IT CERTAINLY APPEARED THAT WAY
IT CERTAINLY FEELS THAT WAY
IT CERTAINLY GIVES YOU HOPE
IT CERTAINLY IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN
IT CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE USED TOO OFTEN
IT CERTAINLY SOUNDED IT AT TIMES
IT CERTAINLY WAS A BIRTHDAY TO REMEMBER
IT CHANGED MY LIFE
IT CHANGED THE VERY LANGUAGE
IT COMES DOWN TO THE POLICE IN ENGLAND
IT COMES FROM REFLECTION OR THINKING
IT COMES ON LIKE A TIDAL WAVE
IT COULD BE A DANGER
IT COULD BE ARGUED THAT THE COUNCIL WAS PUSHED TO THE BRINK
IT COULD BE DONE BY EXPERTS AND LAWYERS
IT COULD BE TO DO WITH THE LOCATION
IT COULD CAUSE A LITTLE BIT OF DISRUPTION
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A CEILIDH
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A HAMMERING BY NOW
IT COULD HAVE BEEN JUST A QUICK FIX
IT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED
IT COULD HAVE GONE EITHER WAY
IT COULD HAVE TAKEN ANOTHER TWO MONTHS
IT COULD LAST FIVE MONTHS
IT COULD NOT BE TOO HIGH
IT COULD NOW BE UP TO THE COURTS
IT COULD TAKE SOME TIME
IT COULD TAKE THREE DAYS
IT COULD TAKE YEARS FOR THE TUNNEL TO BE REOPENED
IT COULD WELL BE MILITARY
IT COULD WELL BE THE CASE
IT COULD WORK
IT DECIDED TO BLAME THE MEDIA
IT DEPENDS ON LABOUR NOT ON US
IT DEPENDS ON THE COUPLE
IT DEPENDS ON THE DECISIONS OF THE MEMBER STATES
IT DEPENDS ON THE INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE
IT DESERVED TO BE A WINNER
IT DID MY IMAGE A LOT OF GOOD
IT DIDN'T COME AS ANY GREAT SURPRISE
IT DIDN'T GET ANY BETTER
IT DIDN'T HELP HIM AS FAR AS WE HAD SEEN
IT DIDN'T MATTER WHO WAS IN THEIR WAY
IT DIDN'T PUT ME OFF
IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG
IT DIDN'T WORK AGAINST SWEDEN BUT THAT WAS THE INTENTION
IT DISAPPEARED INTO THE CUP
IT DIVIDED AUDIENCES AT CANNES
IT DOES AFFECT THE STAFF AND THE PRISONERS
IT DOES AND IT DOESN'T
IT DOES MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
IT DOES NOT APPEAR AT THIS STAGE THAT ALCOHOL WAS A FACTOR
IT DOES NOT EVEN HAVE A STAFF SHORTAGE
IT DOES NOTHING FOR ME
IT DOES NOT MOVE WHICH IS AMAZING
IT DOES NOT STOP AT THE BORDER
IT DOES NOT STOP HERE
IT DOES NOT TAKE MUCH
IT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY IN SCOTTISH FOOTBALL
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK THAT WAY
IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE ANYTHING TOO SERIOUS
IT DOESN'T COME ANY BETTER THAN THIS
IT DOESN'T EXACTLY HAVE THE SAME APPEAL
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE IN INVERNESS
IT DOESN'T LOOK AS PRETTY
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD FOR HER
IT DOESN'T MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENCE
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL ANY BETTER
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
IT DOESN'T MAKE THEM EVIL
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT LONG AGO
IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH
IT DOES SEEM A MYSTERY
IT ENDED AS IT BEGAN IN CONFUSION
I TEND NOT TO LOOK BACK
I TEND TO NOT LOOK BACK
IT EXPECTED THIS TREND TO CONTINUE
IT FEELS LIKE A PRIVILEGE
IT FEELS LIKE A WINNER ALREADY
IT FEELS LIKE TOO MUCH
IT FEELS THAT THE GAME IS OFF
IT FELT LIKE MY SUPPORT SYSTEM WAS LEAVING
IT FELT RIGHT FOR ME
IT FURTHER EXPRESSED HIS DEFIANCE
IT GAVE ME SOMETHING TO FOCUS ON
IT GAVE NO FURTHER DETAILS
IT GETS INTO THE CULTURE
IT GETS TOO MUCH
IT GIVES A COMMITMENT
IT GIVES US HOPE
IT GIVES US SOMETHING TO WORK ON
IT GOES BACK A LONG WAY
IT GOES IN CYCLES
IT GOES WITH THE JOB
IT GOT NO BETTER
IT HAD A GIGANTIC EFFECT
IT HAD ALL BEEN ARRANGED
IT HAD BEEN ACCEPTED
IT HAD BEEN A MAGICAL MOMENT
IT HAD BEEN IN PLACE SINCE LAST JULY
IT HAD BEEN INTRODUCED OVER SIX YEARS
IT HAD BEEN ON THE CARDS
IT HAD BEEN PLAYED AT FESTIVALS
IT HAD HAPPENED ON AVERAGE ONCE A WEEK THIS YEAR
IT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM
IT HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON EUROPEAN EQUITY MARKETS
IT HAD NOT BEEN A TERRIBLY INSPIRING END EITHER
IT HAD SO MUCH TO DO WITH OUTPUT
IT HAD SO MUCH TO DO WITH THE OUTPUT
IT HAD TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE
IT HAD TO HAPPEN
IT HAD UNTIL TOMORROW TO COMPLY
IT HAD WON AN INVESTORS IN PEOPLE AWARD
IT HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
IT HAPPENED AGAIN YESTERDAY
IT HAPPENED ON AVERAGE ONCE A WEEK THIS YEAR
IT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY
IT HAPPENS FROM TIME TO TIME
IT HAPPENS IN MANY COUNTRIES
IT HAPPENS IN REAL LIFE
IT HAPPENS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS
IT HAS AFFECTED IT OBVIOUSLY
IT HAS AFFECTED ME
IT HAS ALL BEEN DONE IN SECRET
IT HAS ALL BEEN POSITIVE
IT HAS A RALLY INSTEAD OF A CONFERENCE
IT HAS BECOME A WAY OF LIFE
IT HAS BECOME VERY CONFUSED
IT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BY HARD WORK AND CAREFUL PLANNING
IT HAS BEEN A FRUSTRATING ONE
IT HAS BEEN A GREAT DAY
IT HAS BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS
IT HAS BEEN A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE TIME
IT HAS BEEN A LOVELY FAMILY OCCASION
IT HAS BEEN A MAGICAL MOMENT
IT HAS BEEN A MAJOR SUCCESS
IT HAS BEEN A MASSIVE SUCCESS
IT HAS BEEN AN AMAZING DAY
IT HAS BEEN AN EXTREMELY LONG HAUL
IT HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE OF FRUSTRATION
IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH YEAR FOR SCOTTISH BUSINESS
IT HAS BEEN A WASTE OF TIME
IT HAS BEEN BLOWN OUT OF ALL PROPORTION
IT HAS BEEN DECLARED
IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR HER TO DO HE SAYS
IT HAS BEEN HANDLED ENTIRELY PROPERLY
IT HAS BEEN HIJACKED
IT HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE LAST JULY
IT HAS BEEN LIKE THAT ALL YEAR FOR ME
IT HAS BEEN MADE TO ENTERTAIN
IT HAS BEEN ONLY AVERAGE
IT HAS BEEN RECORDED TWICE
IT HAS BEEN SUPREMELY SUCCESSFUL
IT HAS BEEN THE YEAR OF THE YOUNGSTER AT KILMARNOCK
IT HAS BEEN WELL WORTH IT
IT HAS CERTAINLY NOT BEEN AN ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE
IT HAS CERTAINLY PAID OFF FOR HIM
IT HAS CHANGED AND NOT FOR THE BETTER
IT HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE THEN
IT HAS COME AS A BOMBSHELL
IT HAS FAILED
IT HAS GREAT POTENTIAL
IT HAS HAPPENED AND THAT IS THE END OF THE STORY
IT HAS HAPPENED FOR GENERATIONS
IT HAS HELPED FOCUS ATTENTION ON JUNIOR GOLF
IT HAS HOWEVER BEEN A LONG TIME COMING
IT HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE
IT HAS MADE ME FEEL GOOD
IT HAS MOVED ON IN THE LAST WEEK
IT HAS NEVER BEEN WORTHWHILE
IT HAS NO CHANCE
IT HAS NO PLACE IN FOOTBALL
IT HAS NOT YET OPENED TO PUPILS
IT HASN'T HAPPENED BUT OTHER THINGS HAVE
IT HASN'T WORKED OUT THAT WAY
IT HAS ONLY BEEN RUMOURS
IT HAS PAID OFF
IT HAS PROVED A DOUBLE WHAMMY
IT HAS RAISED THE PROFILE OF SCOTTISH BANKING
IT HAS REMOVED A BIT OF GUILT
IT HAS STILL TO BE RECOVERED
IT HAS THE BANK OF SCOTLAND BEHIND IT
IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE ANOTHER NORTH SEA
IT HAS TO BE A LONG TERM COMMITMENT
IT HAS TO BE AN EVENT
IT HAS TO BE ENFORCED
IT HAS TO BE FUNDED
IT HAS TO BE LONG TERM COMMITMENT
IT HAS TO BE NOW
IT HAS TO BE PUT IN CONTEXT
IT HAS TO FIND OUT WHAT WENT WRONG
IT HAS TO REINVENT ITSELF
IT HAS TO SOLVE THE NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL PROBLEM
IT HAS TO WORK
IT HAS UNTIL SATURDAY
IT HELPED ME TO GET NOTICED
IT HELPED TO GET ME NOTICED
I THINK A MOVE WOULD CREATE A LOT OF INTEREST
I THINK AT LAST THE COMPANY WILL FIND ITSELF AGAIN
I THINK HE HAS UNDERGONE A SEA CHANGE
I THINK HE'S DONE IT A FEW TIMES
I THINK HE'S THE FAVOURITE
I THINK HE'S THE FAVOURITE NO QUESTION
I THINK HE WAS LOST FOR WORDS
I THINK HE WAS NERVOUS TO BEGIN WITH
I THINK HE WAS SURPRISED
I THINK HE WILL
I THINK HOWEVER HE WAS HAVING A FIT
I THINK I'M A BIT TOO YOUNG
I THINK IN THREE DIMENSIONS
I THINK IT CAN COUNT AGAINST YOU NOW
I THINK IT HAS WORKED
I THINK IT IS A GREAT IDEA
I THINK IT IS A GREAT SHAME
I THINK IT IS A RELEASE OF TENSION
I THINK IT IS A SCANDAL
I THINK IT IS A SENSIBLE CHANGE
I THINK IT IS TOTALLY WRONG
I THINK IT IS WIDE OPEN
I THINK IT'LL BE A GREAT OCCASION
I THINK IT MUST BE THE UNIFORMS
I THINK IT'S A BIG ADVANTAGE TO US
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
I THINK IT'S A DISGRACE
I THINK IT'S A GOOD SIGN
I THINK IT'S A GREAT SYSTEM
I THINK IT'S A MIRACLE
I THINK IT'S A SENSIBLE CHANGE
I THINK IT'S AWFUL

IT IS A WORRY
IT IS BAD NEWS FOR THE FLOODED AREAS
IT IS BAD NEWS FOR US AND ENGLAND
IT IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY
IT IS BASED ON HIS MOVEMENT RECORDS
IT IS BASED ON POPULATION RATHER THAN NEED
IT IS BECOMING A BIT OF A HABIT
IT IS BELIEVED HE HAD BEEN STABBED
IT IS BELIEVED SHE HAD SERIOUS HEAD INJURIES
IT IS BELIEVED THAT HE HAD BEEN STABBED
IT IS BELIEVED THE SIZE OF THE SETTLEMENT HAS NOT BEEN FINALISED
IT IS BEST VALUE
IT IS BEYOND THE GOVERNMENT TO DEAL WITH THIS TRAGEDY
IT IS BIZARRE

IT IS CLOSE TO CALL
IT IS COMING ON VERY WELL
IT IS CRUCIAL FOR BOTH TEAMS
IT IS CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTAND THIS IN CONTEXT
IT IS DANGEROUS AND IT IS A LIE
IT IS DEEPLY FRUSTRATING
IT IS DEEPLY WORRYING
IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ALI
IT IS DIFFICULT TO COMMENT ON THE PROSPECTS FOR THE YEAR AHEAD
IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET INTO THE TEAM AT THE MOMENT
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY
IT IS DIFFICULT WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW ANYONE
IT IS EASY TO AGREE WITH HIM
IT IS EASY TO BE WISE IN HINDSIGHT
IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE WIN THE GAME
IT IS EXPECTED TO LAST A WEEK
IT IS EXTREMELY FORTUNATE
IT IS EXTREMELY POPULAR WITH FAMILIES
IT IS EXTREMELY SAD
IT IS FAIRLY SPECIALISED AND MAINLY FOR THE EXPORT OF BREEDING ANIMALS
IT IS FANTASTIC THAT OTHER WOMEN WILL BE ABLE TO BENEFIT
IT IS FAR TOO EARLY
IT IS FOR POLICY MINISTERS TO DEFEND THEIR POLICIES
IT IS FOR THE SAME REASON
IT IS FRUSTRATING THAT WE CANNOT DO THAT
IT IS FULL SCALE
IT IS GIVING OUT THE WRONG MESSAGE
IT IS GOING TO CHANGE THE WORLD
IT IS GOOD FOOTBALL IN SCOTLAND
IT IS GOOD FOR EUROPE
IT IS GOOD FOR OUR TEAM
IT IS GOOD FOR THEIR EYESIGHT
IT IS GOOD NEWS FOR US

IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE
IT IS HARD TO TELL
IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND
IT IS HARD WON
IT IS HAVING A BIG IMPACT
IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY
IT IS HIGH TIME TO ACT
IT IS HIS SCRIPT
IT IS HIS SPEED OFF THE MARK THAT IS SO IMPRESSIVE
IT IS HOME GROWN
IT IS HONESTLY DIFFICULT TO WRITE ABOUT THIS
IT IS HOPED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER IN THE SUMMER
IT IS HORRIBLE
IT IS HOWEVER AN UNLIKELY OUTCOME
IT IS HUGE
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT HE IS INVOLVED
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT VITAL SERVICES ARE MAINTAINED
IT IS INHERENT IN SOCIETY
IT IS IN OTHER WORDS ENTRAPMENT BY ANOTHER NAME
IT IS IN OUR OWN HANDS
IT IS JUST A MATTER OF TIME
IT IS JUST A STATEMENT OF FACT
IT IS JUST A TAX ON EMPLOYMENT
IT IS JUST COMPLETELY ERASED
IT IS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER CLUB
IT IS JUST LIKE THE STOCK MARKET
IT IS JUST PART OF MODERN DAY LIFE
IT IS JUST SO SAD
IT IS JUST TOO LONG SINCE THE WAR
IT IS JUST TOO TOUGH
IT IS LEGALLY BINDING
IT IS LIKE A BEREAVEMENT
IT IS LIKE A FOOTBALL TEAM
IT IS LIKE A RIVER RUNNING BY MY HOME
IT IS LIKE A THEATRE OF THE ABSURD
IT IS LIKE BEING A QUALIFIER AGAIN
IT IS LIKELY THE REST OF THE MARKET WILL FOLLOW SUIT
IT IS LINKED TO THE ROW OVER PROPOSED CHANGES AT SCOTTISH BALLET
IT IS LONG GONE
IT IS LOOKING VERY SPECIAL
IT IS MAINSTREAM
IT IS MARVELLOUS
IT IS MINUTE
IT IS MISLEADING TO COMPARE THE TWO
IT IS MUCH AS IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED
IT IS MY DECISION AND MY DECISION ALONE
IT IS MY FAULT
IT IS MY LAST CHANCE
IT IS MY NATURE
IT IS NEARLY THERE
IT IS NEVER AN EASY GAME
IT IS NEVER EASY TO WIN AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL
IT IS NICE TO BE A WOMAN AND A WIFE
IT IS NO COUNTRY FOR A MAN OR WOMAN OF LETTERS
IT IS NO GOOD THINKING ABOUT RANGERS AT THIS TIME
IT IS NO MORE THAN A SHELL
IT IS NO PLACE FOR A POET
IT IS NORMAL
IT IS NORMAL FOR ME
IT IS NO SURPRISE
IT IS NOT ABOUT CHANGING OUR IMAGE
IT IS NOT ABOUT THE MONEY IT IS ABOUT EVERYTHING
IT IS NOT A DEFINITE PROPOSAL AS YET
IT IS NOT AFFECTED BY THE SALE
IT IS NOT A FINANCIAL ISSUE
IT IS NOT ALL GOOD NEWS AND RELIEF FOR LABOUR HOWEVER
IT IS NOT A MATERIAL ISSUE FOR A GROUP WITH OUR STRENGTH
IT IS NOT A MATTER OF CONCERN
IT IS NOT AN ABORTION
IT IS NOT AN AMNESTY
IT IS NOT AN ESCAPE
IT IS NOT AN INQUIRY TO CLEAR THE ATHLETES

IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO GET ON BOARD
IT IS NOT TRUE TO HOLLYWOOD NOR THE PLAYER
IT IS NOW BEING EXAMINED
IT IS NOW THE BIG BROTHER
IT IS NOW TIME FOR JUSTICE
IT IS NOW VERY CLEAR THAT DOESN'T WORK
IT IS NOW VERY CLEAR THAT THAT DOESN'T WORK
IT ISN'T A FREE FOR ALL
IT ISN'T A HAPPY MEMORY
IT ISN'T JUST A DEFINING ISSUE FOR THEM
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WE ARE ENGAGED IN A WAR
IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS
IT IS ONLY ONE NIGHT AFTER ALL
IT IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
IT IS ON THE INTERNET
IT IS ON THE NEWS
IT IS OPEN SEASON ON THE OLD FIRM
IT IS OUR OTHER HOME
IT IS OUT THERE
IT IS PAR FOR THE COURSE ISN'T IT
IT IS PAR FOR THE COURSE OF COURSE
IT IS PART AND PARCEL OF IT
IT IS PART OF HIS GAME
IT IS PART OF OUR HERITAGE
IT IS PART OF THEIR JOB
IT IS PATENTLY TRUE
IT IS PERFECTLY EVIDENT THAT THE TIME FOR AN INQUIRY WILL COME
IT IS PHYSICAL BUT IT IS ALSO GOOD
IT IS PLANNED FOR LONDON IN THE SPRING
IT IS PLAYING LONG BUT IT IS ALSO IN BEAUTIFUL CONDITION
IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE TOO GOOD
IT IS PREMATURE TO SPECULATE ON THE IMPACT
IT IS PRETTY BAD NEWS
IT IS PROBABLY IN THE CULTURE
IT IS QUITE A FIGURE
IT IS QUITE A NEW PRESCRIPTION
IT IS QUITE AN EYE OPENER
IT IS QUITE A THING TO WATCH
IT IS QUITE A YOUNG TEAM SO THE FUTURE IS THERE
IT IS QUITE HARD TO TRACK
IT IS QUITE SIMPLE
IT IS REALLY GOOD NEWS
IT IS REALLY SPECIAL TO ME
IT IS REFORM IN RETURN FOR RESOURCES
IT IS RUBBISH
IT IS SAD AND FRUSTRATING
IT IS SAFE IN OUR HANDS
IT IS SCHEDULED TO GO AHEAD NEXT SATURDAY
IT IS SENDING THE WRONG MESSAGE TO PEOPLE
IT IS SERIOUS   BUT NOT THAT SERIOUS
IT IS SET IN PARIS
IT IS SIMPLE AND EASY TO USE
IT IS SIMPLE BUT PROFOUND
IT IS SIMPLE REALLY
IT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE
IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL
IT IS SO DAMAGING
IT IS SO EASY TO BE NEGATIVE
IT IS SO ELUSIVE AND LIGHT
IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL PUT RIGHT
IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT
IT IS SOMETIMES LIKE THAT
IT IS SOMEWHERE TO BE
IT IS SO OUT OF CHARACTER
IT IS SO SAD
IT IS SO UNFAIR
IT IS SO VERY OBVIOUS
IT IS SPONSORED BY THE HERALD
IT IS STILL HOLDING GOOD TODAY
IT IS STILL TOO EARLY FOR ANY LIKELY CONTENDERS TO HAVE EMERGED
IT IS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION WITH THE BOARD
IT IS STILL WITH MINISTERS
IT IS SUITABLE AND SENSIBLE
IT IS SURPRISING TO COME BACK THIS WAY
IT IS THAT SORT OF FILM
IT IS THE BEST PLACE
IT IS THE END OF AN ADVENTURE
IT IS THE END OF AN ERA
IT IS THE HOLIDAY PROGRAMME WITH A MORTGAGE
IT IS THE ICING ON THE CAKE
IT IS THEIR DAY
IT IS THE LAST MEETING OF THE SEASON
IT IS THE LAST WEEK OF REHEARSALS
IT IS THE LATTER WHICH HAS PROMPTED THE WARNING
IT IS THE LOGICAL EXTENSION OF AUDIO DESCRIPTION
IT IS THE LOSS OF MY NAME
IT IS THE MANAGER'S DECISION
IT IS THE MEN WHO CREATE THE DEMAND
IT IS THE NATURE OF HIS PARTY
IT IS THE OLD STORY
IT IS THE ONLY COMPANY OF ITS KIND IN THE UK
IT IS THE ONLY NATURAL BRITISH SITE ON THE LIST
IT IS THE ONLY PRACTICAL ACCESS FOR VEHICLES AND MEN
IT IS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD FOR THE CLUB
IT IS THE QUALITY OF THE WORK THAT COUNTS
IT IS THE RIGHT PACKAGE FOR SCOTLAND
IT IS THE SAME IN SWEDEN
IT IS THE SAME OLD STORY
IT IS THE SAME WITH BARRY
IT IS THE STOP GAP BEFORE EXTINCTION
IT IS THE STRENGTH OF THE SCHOOL
IT IS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG
IT IS THE VOICE OF THE SURVIVORS
IT IS THE WAY THEY WORK
IT IS THE WEALTHIEST IN EUROPE
IT IS THE WHOLE PACKAGE
IT IS THE WORST OF BOTH WORLDS
IT IS THOUGH THE LAW IS NOT CLEAR CUT
IT IS THREE YEARS
IT IS THREE YEARS AT PRESENT
IT IS TIME FOR A MORE HONEST APPROACH
IT IS TIME FOR A NEW APPROACH
IT IS TIME FOR CONCERTED NATIONAL ACTION
IT IS TIME FOR CONFESSION
IT IS TIME FOR NEW WAYS FOR THE CHURCH
IT IS TIME FOR THE TALKING TO STOP
IT IS TIME HE SAID
IT IS TIME TO BE REALISTIC
IT IS TIME TO COME INTO THE LIMELIGHT
IT IS TIME TO FIGHT A DECISIVE BATTLE
IT IS TIME TO GIVE HER A REST
IT IS TOO EARLY TO SAY
IT IS TOO EARLY TO SPECULATE
IT IS TOO MUCH FOR ME
IT IS TOO PRETTY IT IS TOO SMALL
IT IS TOUGH BUT POSSIBLE
IT IS TRUE BUT IT IS ONLY PART OF THE ISSUE
IT IS TRULY FIELDS OF MIRACLES
IT IS TRULY MASTERLY PERFORMANCE
IT IS TURNING THAT WAY ALL ACROSS EUROPE
IT IS TYPICAL OF ME
IT IS UNDERSTOOD HE HAD BEEN STABBED
IT IS UNDERSTOOD THE TIMESCALE FOR THE REFURBISHMENT HAS SLIPPED
IT IS UNDERSTOOD THEY SAW ONE BODY
IT IS UNIQUE
IT IS UNUSUAL
IT IS UP TO ANN
IT IS UP TO US TO APPROVE IT
IT IS URGENT
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND A BUYER
IT IS VERY ENJOYABLE
IT IS VERY FUNNY
IT IS VERY HARD FOR HER
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THE BALANCE RIGHT
IT IS VERY MUCH A MATTER FOR THEM
IT IS VERY MUCH IN THE EYE OF THE INDIVIDUAL
IT IS VERY SIMPLE
IT IS VERY SIMPLE NO ONE IS FORCED TO COMPETE
IT IS VERY SPECIAL FOR ME
IT IS VERY UNFAIR AND SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE
IT IS VITAL TO CLARIFY THEIR ROLE
IT IS WORKING WELL
IT IS WORSE BECAUSE SHE SUFFERS FROM ANGINA
IT JUST CAME INTO MY HEAD THAT DAY
IT JUST COULD BE A GOOD NIGHT
IT JUST GOT OUT OF CONTROL
IT JUST ISN'T A DEFINING ISSUE FOR THEM
IT JUST ISN'T THERE
IT JUST NEVER COMES TOGETHER
IT JUST SHOWS THE ARROGANCE OF LABOUR AND THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS
IT JUST WOULD NOT WORK
IT LASTED LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT
IT LEFT ME WITH A SADNESS
IT LEFT ME WITH SADNESS
IT LOOKED LIKE A RIVER
IT LOOKED LIKE A WAR ZONE
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH HE WILL BE RIGHT
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE ISSUE WITH THE SCOTSMAN IS TOO SENSITIVE
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THERE IS NO CHANCE
IT LOOKS AT PUBLIC INTEREST ISSUES
IT LOOKS LIKE A HIT
IT LOOKS LIKE PARADISE
IT LOOKS THAT WAY
IT MADE ME DETERMINED TO GET BACK
IT MAKES A COMPELLING DISPLAY
IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE
IT MAKES FOR AN INTERESTING CONFERENCE
IT MAKES ME FEEL DIFFICULT
IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO THEIR FRIENDSHIP
IT MAKES NO INFLUENCE ON THE PUBLIC
IT MAKES NO SENSE
IT MAY ALSO BE HER LAST
IT MAY BE ARGUED
IT MAY BE DOWN BUT NEW YORK IS NOT OUT
IT MAY BE GOOD FOR THE SOUL
IT MAY BE HIS LAST FOR A WHILE TOO
IT MAY BE THAT LIFESTYLE IS BEHIND IT
IT MAY BE THE FIRST OF MANY
IT MAY BE TOMORROW   BUT IT MAY BE LATER
IT MAY ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO PROSPECT
IT MAY HAVE BEEN A CRY FOR HELP
IT MAY MEAN MORE MONEY BUT WE DON'T NEED THE MONEY
IT MAY NOT BE LIFE LONG
IT MAY NOT EVEN BE POSSIBLE
IT MAY NOW BE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR ANYONE
IT MAY PROVE TO BE HIS LAST INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CLUB
IT MAY TAKE TIME TO GET IT BACK
IT MAY WELL HAVE BEEN
IT MEANS A HUGE AMOUNT
IT MEANS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT
IT MEANS IT IS DIFFICULT
IT MEANS THE MARGIN FOR ERROR IS TIGHT
IT MEANS THEY ACTUALLY CONTROL THE PROGRAMME
IT MEANS WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME PATIENCE
IT MEANT A LOT TO US
IT MIGHT BE
IT MIGHT BE SAD BUT IT'S A FACT
IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO HAVE SOMETHING IN BLACK AND WHITE
IT MIGHT CHANGE YOUR LIFE
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SATANIC RITUAL
IT MIGHT HAVE LED TO A SCREEN CAREER BUT IT DIDN'T
IT MIGHT NOT SURVIVE THE PROCESS
IT MUST BE TOUGH TO LIVE WITH
IT MUST NEVER BE SEEN AS SECOND CLASS
IT MUST NOT HAPPEN
IT NEED NOT BE LIKE THAT
IT NEEDS A RETHINK
IT NEEDS A TEAM APPROACH
IT NEEDS SOMEBODY TO GIVE WAY
IT NEEDS TO BE SORTED OUT BY EASTER
IT NEEDS TO BE VOLATILE
IT OBVIOUSLY CHANGES THE PROSPECTS FOR GETTING AGREEMENT
IT OFFERS A DIFFERENT VIEWPOINT
I TOLD HER AND SHE WAS EXTREMELY GRATEFUL
I TOLD HIM I WAS A LONG TIME AGO
I TOLD THAT TO THE POLICE
I TOLD THEM DURING THEIR MORNING BREAK
I TOLD THEM THEY SHOULDN'T SAY THAT
I TOLD THE PLAYERS THAT AT HALF TIME
I TOLD YOU I WAS ILL
I TOLD YOU SO
I TOLD YOU YOU WERE DOING IT ALL WRONG
IT ONLY INCREASED THE SUPPORT FOR HIM
I TOOK A MINIBUS INTO TOWN
I TOOK MY CHANCE
I TOOK THE GUN
IT OPENED LAST MONTH
IT OPENS THE DOOR TO THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE
IT PARTICULARLY INCREASES UNDER AGE DRINKING HE CLAIMED
IT PLAINLY DOES NOT WORK
IT PLANS TO RETURN TO THIS FIELD
IT POSSIBLY DEPENDS ON THE POSITION
IT PROBABLY DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING SHE ADDED
IT PROVED A GOOD DECISION
IT PUTS THE THOUGHT OUT FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT
IT RAISES A SERIOUS QUESTION MARK
IT RAISES THE EDGE
IT REALLY HAS LEFT THE TOWN IN SHOCK
IT REALLY HAS NOT BEEN THEIR SEASON
IT REALLY IS A GIFT TO THE WORLD
IT REALLY IS GOOD TO BE BACK
IT REALLY IS TAKEN SERIOUSLY
IT REALLY IS TREMENDOUS
IT REALLY WAS A MASTERFUL INNINGS
IT REALLY WAS AN UNUSUAL AWARD
IT REALLY WAS MY FAVOURITE
IT RECOMMENDED THAT THEY REJECT THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION
IT REMAINS IN PUBLIC OWNERSHIP
IT REPRESENTS A COMPLETE CHANGE IN EMPHASIS
IT REQUIRES A WIDER TEAM
I TRIED TO BE CAUTIOUS BUT IT'S HARD IN THAT ROLE
I TRIED TO PUSH HIM AWAY
IT RUNS IN CYCLES
IT RUNS UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF JUNE
I TRY NOT TO EXPECT ANYTHING
I TRY TO BE CLEAR IN THE NARRATIVE
I TRY TO BE OPEN TO EXPERIENCE
IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE FOR THE AUDIENCE
IT'S A BIG DEAL FOR ME
IT'S A BIG MYSTERY
IT'S A BIT LIKE A BEREAVEMENT
IT'S A BLESSING
IT'S A BLUNT INSTRUMENT ANYWAY
IT'S ABOUT ATTITUDES TO CHANGE
IT'S ABOUT BRINGING PEOPLE IN BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS
IT'S ABOUT DOING THINGS
IT'S ABOUT MY TIME AS A GUITARIST
IT'S ABOUT NEW YORKERS
IT'S ABOUT TAKING RISKS
IT'S ABOUT THE BALANCE
IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMETHING WAS DONE ABOUT EQUIPMENT
IT'S A COMMISSION AND FOR IT'S WORK A YEAR'S WORK
IT'S A COMMISSION AND IT'S FOR WORK A YEAR'S WORK
IT'S A CREATIVE ENERGY
IT'S A CRUCIAL AWARD
IT'S A DEAD END
IT'S A DELIGHTFUL IDEA BUT A DISTANCING ONE
IT'S A DEPRESSING DIFFICULT AND DEMANDING JOB
IT'S A DIFFICULT JOB
IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE TO COMMENT ON
IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE TO PLAY
IT'S A DOUBLE WHAMMY
IT'S A DROP IN THE BUCKET
IT'S A FACT
IT'S A FANTASTIC ACHIEVEMENT
IT'S A FLOURISHING AND BEAUTIFUL CITY
IT'S A GIGANTIC CON
IT'S A GOOD OFFER BY ANY STANDARDS
IT'S A GOOD START
IT'S A GOOD STORY
IT'S A GREAT IDEA
IT'S A GREAT THING
IT'S A GREY AREA
IT'S AHEAD OF LABOUR
IT'S A HIDDEN PROBLEM
IT'S A HORRIFIC INCIDENT
IT'S A HUGE AMOUNT
IT'S A HUMAN TRAGEDY
IT'S A JOKE
IT'S A KILLER PIECE
IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY MONEY MONEY
IT'S ALL ABOUT UNFINISHED BUSINESS
IT'S ALL A PART OF LETTING IT GO
IT'S ALL BEEN ABOUT THE BASICS OF THE BUSINESS
IT S ALL CHANGE AT KILMARNOCK
IT'S ALL CHANGE AT KILMARNOCK
IT'S ALL CHANGE ON THE MUSIC SCENE IN MANCHESTER
IT'S ALL DESIGNED TO SPEED UP THE SERVICE
IT'S ALL GOING TO CLEAR THE DEBT
IT'S ALL HAPPENING AT A LOCAL LEVEL
IT'S ALL I CAN DO
IT S ALL IN THE HAIR
IT'S ALL TOO EARLY
IT'S ALL TOO SHORT TERM
IT'S ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO HELP
IT'S A LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE FORMULA
IT'S A LONG PROCESS
IT'S A LONG TERM SOLUTION
IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ME
IT'S A LOVELY LOVELY FILM
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT THEY ARE NOT SEEN AS A SOFT OPTION
IT'S ALWAYS A DILEMMA
IT'S ALWAYS A REHEARSAL
IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO PLAY ON CENTRE COURT
IT'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY ELSE'S
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME ISN'T IT
IT'S ALWAYS THE WAY
IT'S A MATTER FOR THE COMMITTEE
IT'S A MATTER OF BALANCE
IT'S A MATTER OF HUGE CONCERN
IT'S A MATTER OF TIME
IT'S AMAZING BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN A DRUG TEST IN SCOTLAND
IT'S AMAZING IT HAPPENED IN DAYTIME
IT'S AMAZING IT HAPPENED IN THE DAYTIME
IT'S A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY
IT'S A METAPHOR FOR CONSUMPTION
IT'S A MIRACLE
IT'S A MIXTURE OF EVERYTHING
IT'S A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE NONSENSE
IT'S AN AMAZING LANDSCAPE
IT'S A NATIONAL SPORT
IT'S AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY
IT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA THAT MAKES SENSE
IT'S AN EXPENSIVE PART OF THEIR EQUIPMENT
IT'S AN HOUR OF THE SAME RESPONSE
IT'S AN IDEA
IT'S AN INTERESTING DEBATE TO GET GOING
IT'S AN INTERESTING TITLE BELIEVING IN BRITAIN
IT'S AN INTERNAL MATTER
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WILL HAVE TO BE TACKLED
IT'S ANNOYING IN A WAY
IT'S AN OLD STORY
IT'S AN OPTION BUT I CAN'T REALLY COMMENT
IT'S A PERSONAL MATTER
IT'S A POLICY WHICH HAS WORKED FOR US
IT'S A PORTRAIT OF GLASGOW NOT THE PORTRAIT
IT'S A PROBLEM BUT IT CANNOT BECOME AN EXCUSE
IT'S A PRODUCTION COMPANY
IT'S A QUESTION OF CREATING A FUTURE AWARENESS
IT'S A QUESTION OF FASHION
IT'S A QUESTION OF PERCEPTION
IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE
IT'S A REAL PROBLEM
IT'S A REAL THREAT
IT'S A RECORD LABEL NOT A FORM OF MUSIC
IT'S A RELIEF THAT A DECISION HAS FINALLY BEEN MADE
IT'S A SCANDAL A DISGRACE
IT'S A SENSIBLE MANAGEMENT DECISION
IT'S AS EVENTFUL AS IT IS MOMENTOUS
IT'S A SHAME
IT'S A SIGN OF THE TIMES
IT'S A SOURCE OF DEEP CONCERN
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT
IT'S A STRATEGY WHICH WOULD WORK BEYOND THIS SHOW
IT'S AS WE WERE YESTERDAY
IT'S AS WIDE AS A CHURCH IN HERE
IT'S A TECHNICAL DEMAND
IT'S A TOUGH OLD JOB TO GET FOR YOUR FIRST JOB
IT'S A TRAGEDY FOR THE AREA
IT'S A TRUE STORY
IT'S A VERY HIGH NUMBER
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT AND BEAUTIFUL DAY
IT'S A VERY SPECIAL UNIT
IT'S A VERY VERY SPECIAL DAY
IT'S A WAY OF LIFE
IT'S A WAY OF MAKING A MARK
IT'S A WINNER
IT'S A WONDERFUL PIECE OF WATER
IT'S BACK TO HOW IT USED TO BE
IT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE
IT'S BEEN A GOOD YEAR
IT'S BEEN A GREAT EVENING FOR US
IT'S BEEN A HUMBLING YEAR
IT'S BEEN A LONG LONG JOURNEY
IT'S BEEN A LONG WAIT
IT'S BEEN AN EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING YEAR FOR ME
IT'S BEEN A TERRIBLE ORDEAL FOR MARGARET
IT'S BEEN HANDLED ENTIRELY PROPERLY
IT'S BEEN HARD
IT'S BEEN LIKE THAT FOR AGES ACCORDING TO THE GUYS
IT'S BEEN MY LIFE
IT'S BEEN QUITE A TURNAROUND FOR MIAMI
IT'S BEEN SUCH A LONG HAUL
IT'S BEEN SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY
IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT
IT'S BEEN VERY EXCITING VERY CHALLENGING AND A PRIVILEGE
IT'S BEING VERY CAREFULLY LOOKED AT
IT'S BETTER THAN THAT IT'S FANTASTIC
IT'S BETTER TO BE HAPPY
ITS BODY LANGUAGE IS ALL WRONG
IT'S CALLED THE SUPREME COURT FOR A REASON
IT'S CERTAINLY DIFFERENT
IT'S CLEARLY A BUDGET
IT'S DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE FUTURE
IT'S DIFFICULT TO PUT A DATE ON
IT'S EASY TO BE NEGATIVE ABOUT THESE THINGS
IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY
IT'S EASY TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS IN THE ABSTRACT
IT SEEMED A LOGICAL EXPANSION
IT SEEMED A MOVING AND FITTING TRIBUTE
IT SEEMED LIKE FOUR HOURS
IT SEEMED SO PERSONAL
IT SEEMED THE TOUGH TIMES WERE BEHIND HIM
IT SEEMED TO HAVE DIRECTION
IT SEEMS A GOOD THING TO TRY
IT SEEMS A LITTLE SHORT TO ME
IT SEEMS A LONG TIME AGO
IT SEEMS A SHAME TO LEAVE IT
IT SEEMS A WASTE OF TALENTS
IT SEEMS SO LONG SINCE I DID THE EXAMS
IT SEEMS TO GO DOWN WELL
IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN AN OWN GOAL
IT SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED
IT SEEMS VERY ODD
ITS EFFECT ON HUMANS IS NOT YET KNOWN
IT SEPARATES THE MEN FROM THE BOYS
ITS FAILURE IS NO SURPRISE
IT'S FANTASTIC TO HAVE FINALLY WON
IT'S FANTASTIC TO WIN AGAIN
ITS FIRST AWARDS WILL DO JUST THAT
ITS FIRST AWARDS WILL JUST DO THAT
IT'S FOR THAT REASON HE SHOULD RESIGN
IT'S FUN AND CHALLENGING BUT IT IS NOT EASY
IT'S FUNNY HOW IT COMES AND GOES
ITS FUTURE IS NO LONGER IN QUESTION
ITS FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN
IT'S GETTING TO ME
IT'S GOING TO BE A NEW CHALLENGE
IT'S GOING TO BE EPIC
IT'S GOING TO BE FUN
IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT
IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE A CHALLENGE
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY CLOSELY WATCHED
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
IT'S GOING TO HAVE A HELL OF AN EFFECT
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME
IT'S GOOD FOR THE CITY
IT'S GOOD FUN AND MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING
IT'S GOOD NEWS
IT'S GOOD NEWS AND LONG OVERDUE
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A VOICE
IT'S GOOD TO START WITH JUDITH
IT'S GOT TO BE IN THE HEAD
IT'S GOT TO COME FROM ME
IT'S GREAT BECAUSE IT TAKES A LOT OF PRESSURE OFF THE PLAYERS
IT'S GREAT FUN TO GET TO ACT
IT'S GREAT NEWS ISN'T IT
IT'S GREAT THAT IT HAPPENED IN BRITAIN
IT'S HAPPENED BUT IT'S A DREAM
IT'S HARD BUT IF WE DON'T DO IT NOBODY WILL
IT'S HARD BUT WE HAVE HAD SO MUCH TO DO
IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR A FATHER ANYWAY AND I WAS FOREVER GRATEFUL
IT'S HARDER BELIEVE ME
IT'S HARD NOT TO
IT'S HARD TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS AT MY AGE
IT'S HARD TO SAY
IT'S HARD TO SEE IT
IT SHOULD BE A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT
IT SHOULD BE A GREAT GAME THOUGH
IT SHOULD BE AN ENJOYABLE AND CHALLENGING PERIOD OF THEIR LIVES
IT SHOULD BE A PRETTY EXCITING SESSION
IT SHOULD BE DEVOLVED
IT SHOULD BE EASY
IT SHOULD BE EQUAL
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT HE HAS BEEN RELEASED WITHOUT CHARGE
IT SHOULD BE SCRAPPED
IT SHOULD BE THE REVERSE
IT SHOULD HAVE A HEALTH WARNING   IT IS ADDICTIVE
IT SHOULD HAVE ITS OWN NETWORK
IT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN A YEAR FOR A COMPANY THIS SIZE
IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED
IT SHOULD NOT LOSE OUT IN ANY WAY
IT SHOULD NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN
IT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM
IT SHOULDN'T COME AS A SURPRISE BUT IT DOES
IT SHOWED HIM THE WAY TO DRIVE
IT SHOWS A CONTEMPT BY HIM FOR THE INDUSTRY
IT SHOWS A GREAT DEAL TO COME BACK UNDER THAT MENTAL PRESSURE
IT SHOWS THAT PAINTING IS STILL RELEVANT
IT SHOWS THAT WE ARE A CIVILISED SOCIETY
IT SHOWS THAT WE ARE CIVILISED SOCIETY
IT SHOWS THE GOVERNMENT IS LISTENING
IT SHOWS THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF PROGRESS
IT SHOWS THE STRENGTH OF THE ROOTS
IT SHOWS WE'RE NOT MUCH OF A RUGBY COUNTRY
IT SIMPLY DOESN'T HAPPEN
IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET IT RIGHT
IT'S IN HIS BLOOD
IT'S IN THE EYES
IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT WAY OF LIFE
IT'S JUST A FACT
IT'S JUST A FAILING SERVICE
IT'S JUST AN AREA OF WATER
IT'S JUST A NORMAL LIFE
IT'S JUST A PLACE TO OPEN IT
IT'S JUST A TRAINING THING
IT'S JUST AWFUL
IT'S JUST FOR ME
IT'S JUST GOTTEN TOO BIG
IT'S JUST NOT FUNNY
IT'S JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH
IT'S JUST NOT OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM
IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS
IT'S JUST OUTRAGEOUS
IT'S JUST SO SAD
IT'S JUST THAT WE SEE DIFFERENT THINGS
IT'S JUST THE TIMING OF THE GAME
IT'S JUST THE WAY I PLAY
IT'S JUST THE WORKINGS OF THE SCOTTISH MEDIA
IT'S LIKE A BASKETBALL
IT'S LIKE A CAR CRASH
IT'S LIKE A FOOTBALL TEAM
IT'S LIKE A GARAGE
IT'S LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL PLAY
IT'S LIKE AN EXTENSION OF YOUR BODY
IT'S LIKE A SCORE IN SOME WAYS
IT'S LIKE ENGLISH IN ITS UNDERWEAR
IT'S LIKE IF HE'S ALL RIGHT WE WILL GO WITH HIM
IT'S LIKE THE RUSSIANS
ITS LOSS WAS AN ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE FOR THE WHOLE OF MORAY
IT'S MORE LIKE A LABOUR PARTY RALLY
IT'S MORE RELAXING THIS WAY
IT'S MUCH MORE DYNAMIC
IT'S MY DELIGHT ON A SHINY NIGHT
IT'S MY FAVOURITE PLACE TO HANG OUT
IT'S MY INITIAL BACKGROUND
IT'S MY NATURE
ITS NATIONAL DEFENCE POLICY IS DEFENSIVE IN NATURE
IT'S NEVER BEEN TO COMMITTEE
IT'S NEVER EASY TO WIN AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL
IT'S NEVER GREAT TO FINISH SECOND
IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE
IT'S NEVER OVER UNTIL IT'S OVER
IT'S NEVER THE SAME PROBLEM
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE
IT'S NICE TO BE INVOLVED
IT'S NICE TO BE NICE
IT'S NICE TO HEAR
IT'S NICE TO SEE A VERY POSITIVE STYLE OF FOOTBALL
IT'S NO LESS INTRIGUING HOWEVER
IT'S NOT ABOUT DEFINING STYLES
IT'S NOT A GAME
IT'S NOT A GREAT ART
IT'S NOT A HOLIDAY TIME FOR FOOTBALL PLAYERS
IT'S NOT A LACK OF CONFIDENCE
IT'S NOT A LACK OF EFFORT
IT'S NOT A MARKETING SCHEME
IT'S NOT AN EASY LIFE
IT'S NOT A NEW CONCEPT IN JAZZ
IT'S NOT A NEW DEVICE
IT'S NOT AN IMPRESSION
IT'S NOT AN IMPROVEMENT FOR HIM
IT'S NOT A PARTY NO NO
IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF TALKING
IT'S NOT A QUICK FIX

IT'S NOT FAIR
IT'S NOT GOING TO LAST FIVE MINUTES
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK OUT THAT WAY
IT'S NOT GOOD AT ALL
IT'S NOT HARD TO GET INVOLVED
IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH ME
IT'S NOT IDEAL
IT'S NOT IN MY NATURE
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE SHOWS
IT'S NOT JUST A CHALLENGE FOR US
IT'S NOT JUST A MALE AGENDA
IT'S NOT JUST FOR CLASSICAL MUSIC
IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO BE BUSY
IT'S NOT LIKE US
IT'S NOT LONG ENOUGH
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
IT'S NOT OF COURSE A CONCERT HALL
IT'S NOT ONE FOR THE PURIST
IT'S NOT ONE FOR THE PURISTS
IT'S NOT ONE OR THE OTHER YOU HAVE TO HAVE BOTH
IT'S NOT ONLY MY RESPECT FOR THEM
IT'S NOT PERFECT
IT'S NOT PRETTY BUT IT'S EFFECTIVE
IT'S NOT REALISTIC BECAUSE IT'S EARLY DAYS
IT'S NOT RIGHT OF LABOUR
IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR CUT
IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT IT REALLY ISN'T
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE MATTER OF COURSE
IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT
IT'S NOT THE TOUR
IT'S NOT TRUE
IT'S NOT UNLIKE THE MILLENNIUM BUG
IT'S NOT VERY PRETTY BUT IT'S EFFECTIVE
IT'S NOW DOWN IN BLACK AND WHITE
IT'S ONE UP TO THE SCOTS
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF SCALE
IT'S ONLY FAIR
IT'S ONLY TACKLING CONGESTION
IT'S ON WITH A ROLLER
IT SOUNDED AS IF IT MIGHT WELL BE TRAGIC
IT SOUNDED AWFULLY LIKE PANIC
IT SOUNDED LIKE A BOMB
IT SOUNDS A BIT OF AN OWN GOAL
IT SOUNDS A LOT OF MONEY
IT SOUNDS LIKE AN APPALLING TRAGIC INCIDENT
IT SOUNDS LIKE A WISH LIST
IT'S OUR WORST NIGHTMARE

IT'S SOMETHING WE WANT TO MAKE WORK
IT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME
IT'S SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN
IT'S SO MUCH MORE FUN
IT'S SO NICE TO SEE THE REACTION ON THEIR FACES
IT'S SO SPECIAL
IT'S STILL GOT THAT AT ITS HEART
IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PLACE LIKE A PALACE IN ITALY
IT'S SUCH A SHOCK
IT'S SUCH A TRAGEDY
IT'S SUCH A TRIAL
IT STARTS AT THE TOP
IT STARTS TO GET YOU DOWN
IT STARTS WITH THE SCRIPT

IT'S TERRIBLE THAT THIS IS HAPPENING
IT'S THAT KIND OF PLACE
IT'S THAT SORT OF NIGHT
IT'S THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
IT'S THE BIG OMISSION
IT'S THE BODY THAT COUNTS
IT'S THE CURSE OF OUR TIME IRONY
IT'S THEIR DUTY TO PROTECT THEM

IT WILL WORK
IT WON'T BE THEIR LAST
IT WON'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BUT THINGS WILL GET BETTER
IT WON THE MATCH
IT WORKED UP TO A POINT
IT WORKED WELL IN MONACO

IT WOULD BE A BONUS FOR THIS GAME
IT WOULD BE A LAST RESORT
IT WOULD BE A MASSIVE BOOST FOR THEM

IT WOULD MAKE A LOT OF SENSE
IT WOULD NOT DO ANY HARM TO REINFORCE THE MESSAGE
IT WOULDN'T GO OFF
IT WOULDN'T MATTER IF HE HAD
IT WOULD SEEM A NATURAL PROGRESSION
IT WOULD SHOW THEM A POSITIVE WAY FORWARD
IT WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN A GOOD FILM BUT VERY DIFFERENT
IT WOULD THEN BE UP TO THE JUDGE

THAT LEFT A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH
THAT MAY BE
THAT MEANS A BAN ON FRENCH PRODUCTS
THAT MEANS AN EXTRA TWO YEARS
THAT MEANS NO MORE TAXATION BY STEALTH
THAT MEANS THAT NOBODY CAN DO IT
THAT MEANT THE SEARCH WAS UNLAWFUL
THAT MIGHT BE A PUNISHMENT BUT IT WOULD ALSO PUNISH THE PATIENTS

THIS IS THE TIME TO USE IT
THIS IS THE VERSION WHICH APPEARED IN OUR PAPER
THIS IS THE WAY THINGS SHOULD BE HANDLED
THIS IS THE WINDOW

THIS IS USUALLY DONE BY THE SPACE SHUTTLE
THIS IS VERY BAD NEWS
THIS IS VERY GOOD NEWS

THIS KIND OF PROBLEM ARISES EVERYWHERE
THIS KIND OF TRAFFIC IS COMMONPLACE
THIS LATTER POINT IS HUGELY IMPORTANT
THIS LATTER SUGGESTION IS VERY IMPORTANT

THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S ANYTHING BUT OPEN
THIS MAKES NO SENSE
THIS MAKES UP FOR IT
THIS MAN COULD YET WIN OVER SCOTTISH HEARTS
THIS MAN IS SERIOUS ABOUT HIS WORK
THIS MAN MUST BE HELPED TO KEEP HIS ARM
THIS MARKET HAS BEEN NEGLECTED BY THE WHISKY INDUSTRY
THIS MATTER HAS STILL TO COME BEFORE THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
THIS MAY BE PERFECTLY INNOCENT
THIS MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO THE FAMILIES
THIS MEANS A LOT OF HARD DECISIONS
THIS MEANS THAT OUR PROGRAMME IS QUITE UNUSUAL
THIS MEASURE IS NOT ADJUSTED FOR SEASONAL FACTORS
THIS MEETING IS THE PATH TO SALVATION
THIS MIGHT SEEM LIKE AN OUTRAGEOUS ASSERTION
THIS MORNING I GOT A CALL FROM MY WIFE
THIS MORNING WAS VERY QUIET
THIS MUCH I CAN TELL YOU
THIS MUST BE KEPT IN TOTAL PERSPECTIVE
THIS MUST BE REALLY SHORT OF IDEAS
THIS MUST BE WRONG
THIS MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERE
THIS NEWS CAME AFTER THE STOCK MARKET CLOSED ON MONDAY
THIS NEWS IS REALLY DEPRESSING
THIS OBSESSION WASN'T JUST CONTAINED WITHIN THE WORLD OF THE LOSERS
THIS ONE DID
THIS ONE IS A SPECIAL CASE
THIS ONE WAS MY BEST CHANCE
THIS ONE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SO DIFFERENT
THIS ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN
THIS OPERATION WILL CHANGE HER LIFE
THIS PATTON WILL ALSO RETURN
THIS PERFORMANCE HAS GIVEN MY CONFIDENCE A BOOST
THIS PLACE IS OUTSTANDING
THIS PLAN IS ALL ABOUT RESPECT
THIS PLAN IS AN AGENDA FOR ACTION
THIS PROCESS OF ATTRITION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE
THIS PRODUCES EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE EFFECT
THIS REASON IS TO DO WITH THE NATURE OF THE SCOTLAND MANAGER
THIS REMAINS THE CASE
THIS REMAINS THE PARTY'S POLICY
THIS REPRESENTS A TOUGH GAME FOR US
THIS RESEARCH IS EXTREMELY PROMISING
THIS RESULTED IN THE FOLLOWING
THIS RULE IS ARCHAIC
THIS RULING IS A FARCE
THIS RULING IS UNFAIR TO EVERYONE
THIS SEASON HAS BEEN A MIXTURE OF FRUSTRATION AND FULFILMENT
THIS SEASON HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE
THIS SEASON HAS BEEN GREAT FOR ME IT'S BEEN AN EXPERIENCE
THIS SEEMS LIKE A VERY GOOD IDEA
THIS SERIES IS FOR REAL
THIS SHOULD BEGIN IN OCTOBER
THIS SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE
THIS SHOULD INCLUDE PROCEDURES FOR PERSONAL IMPORTS
THIS SHOULD PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON INFLATION
THIS SOLUTION IS NOT BEING CONSIDERED IN SCOTLAND
THIS STATEMENT HAS NEVER BEEN WITHDRAWN
THIS TAKES NO ACCOUNT OF HOTEL AND TOURISM LOSSES
THIS TAKES THE PRESSURE OFF
THIS TERM THEY ARE SECOND BOTTOM WITH THREE GAMES LEFT TO PLAY
THIS TIME FOR RANGERS IT IS CERTAINLY THE LATTER
THIS TIME HE WILL BE MORE ON THE DEFENSIVE
THIS TIME HOWEVER MAY HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT
THIS TIME HOWEVER THERE IS A NEW VENUE
THIS TIME IT IS OFFICIAL
THIS TIME IT MIGHT BE FOR REAL
THIS TIME IT REALLY COULD HAPPEN
THIS TIME IT WAS NOT BE
THIS TIME IT WAS OUT OF THE BLUE
THIS TIME IT WILL HAVE OPENED UP THE FIELD A LITTLE BIT
THIS TIME THERE WERE NO SUCH REWARDS
THIS TIME WE MAY NOT BE SEEKING VOLUNTEERS
THIS TOO COULD PROVE A RISKY BUSINESS
THIS TOO COULD PROVOKE A RISKY BUSINESS
THIS TOUR IS CRITICAL FOR NEW ZEALAND RUGBY
THIS TREND IS LIKELY TO STRENGTHEN
THIS VIEW WAS ECHOED BY ANOTHER SCOTTISH ANALYST
THIS VIEW WAS ECHOED BY THE OTHER SCOTTISH ANALYST
THIS WAS A CHILLING ECHO
THIS WAS A FAR CRY FROM HIS ELECTION PLEDGES
THIS WAS A GOOD MOVE FOR ME
THIS WAS A GOOD PERFORMANCE
THIS WAS A GREAT RESULT FOR US A BIG RESULT
THIS WAS ALL WELL AND GOOD
THIS WAS A LOT OF NUMBERS
THIS WAS A MASSIVE RESULT FOR US
THIS WAS AN HOUR BEFORE THE SHOW
THIS WAS AN OPTION FROM THE BEGINNING
THIS WAS ANOTHER VIDEO CASSETTE
THIS WAS A RATIONING DECISION
THIS WAS A UNIQUE ELECTION
THIS WAS A VERY TRAGIC ACCIDENT
THIS WAS CERTAINLY NOT ABOUT MONEY
THIS WAS DISMISSED AS ABSOLUTE NONSENSE
THIS WAS DONE BY THE COUNCIL STAFF
THIS WAS EXTREMELY FOOLISH BEHAVIOUR ON YOUR PART
THIS WAS GREAT FOR OUR SPORT
THIS WAS MUCH WORSE
THIS WAS NEVER A SUPPORT GROUP
THIS WAS NO ACCIDENT
THIS WAS NOT A CONTEST
THIS WAS NOT AN EASY MEETING FOR ME
THIS WAS NOT A SUMMIT ABOUT THE EURO
THIS WAS NOT HELPFUL
THIS WAS NOT JUST INCONGRUOUS
THIS WAS NOT THE SHOW FOR ME
THIS WASN'T JUST A BIG CROWD
THIS WASN'T SOMETHING WE WANTED TO RUSH INTO
THIS WASN'T THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
THIS WAS REPEATED THE SECOND TIME
THIS WAS THE CLASSICAL PERIOD OF BEETHOVEN
THIS WAS THE PERFECT SETTING
THIS WAS THE PERFORMANCE AND THE RESULT THEY NEEDED
THIS WEEK IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE
THIS WILL BE GREAT FOR THE YOUNG LADS
THIS WILL BE JUST ANOTHER TAX ON MOTORISTS
THIS WILL BE NO EASY OPTION
THIS WILL BE OUR NEW BEGINNING
THIS WILL GET THEIR ATTENTION
THIS WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE CHAMPIONSHIP
THIS WILL HAVE TO CHANGE
THIS WILL HELP OUR CONFIDENCE
THIS WILL IMPACT ON US
THIS WILL LOOK AT CONSUMER ATTITUDES
THIS WILL SAVE INTEREST CHARGES
THIS WILL SECURE THE FUTURE OF OUR INDUSTRY
THIS WILL TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS
THIS WILL TAKE UP TO NINE MONTHS
THIS WORK ON A MARKETING STRATEGY WOULD BE FINISHED WITHIN TWO MONTHS
THIS WOULD DISCOURAGE INVESTMENT AND JOB CREATION
THIS WOULD GIVE SCOTLAND AROUND EIGHT MEMBERS
THIS WOULD INCLUDE INSURANCE
THIS WOULD INCLUDE THE GM FOOD INDUSTRY
THIS WOULD INDICATE A SURGE IN INFLATION WAS UNLIKELY
THIS WOULD NOT BE MY FIRST CHOICE
THIS WOULD PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT AND WELCOME BOOST FOR LOCAL EMPLOYMENT
THIS YEAR IT WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT
THIS YEAR IT WILL AMOUNT TO A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS
THIS YEAR IT WILL BE BILLY CRYSTAL
THIS YEAR I UNDERSTOOD
THIS YEAR THE EXERCISE IS BEING REPEATED
THIS YEAR THIS MONTH WILL BE SPECIAL FOR TORRANCE
THIS YOUNGSTER IS SO EXCITING
THOMSON AND HIS FAMILY LEFT COURT WITHOUT COMMENT
THOMSON IS EXPECTED TO MANAGE THE BUSINESS
THOSE ARE DIFFICULT DECISIONS
THOSE OVERSEAS OFFICES WERE GREAT
THOSE PEOPLE MUST BE ACCOUNTABLE
THOSE THREE GOALS IN FIVE MINUTES CHANGED THE GAME
THOSE THREE WEEKS ARE TOTALLY LOST
THOSE WERE THE DAYS
THOSE WERE THE DAYS INDEED
THOSE WHO ARE PREPARING TO GIVE UP
THOSE WHO ARE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO IMPROVE
THOUSANDS OF BRITISH TOURISTS WERE TRAPPED IN THEIR HOTELS
THOUSANDS OF HOMES WERE LEFT WITHOUT POWER SUPPLIES
THOUSANDS OF OTHERS HAVE NOT BEEN SO FORTUNATE
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE MISSING
THREE BYSTANDERS WERE KILLED
THREE DAYS LATER HE WAS KILLED
THREE FURTHER CASES WERE CONFIRMED YESTERDAY IN SCOTLAND
THREE HIT THE TARGET
THREE HOURS LATER THE MAN WAS FREE
THREE MONTHS OR SO LATER THEY ARE RETURNING
THREE OTHER PEOPLE WERE TREATED FOR MINOR INJURIES
THREE OTHERS WERE WOUNDED
THREE PENALTIES WERE GIVEN
THREE PEOPLE WERE PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE SCENE
THREE SENIOR OFFICIALS WERE DISMISSED LAST WEEK
THREE WEEKS LATER HE RESIGNED
THREE YEARS AGO HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
THREE YEARS PROBATION IS JUST A JOKE
THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOWS IN VARIOUS WAYS
THUS FAR WE HAVE RECEIVED NO COMPLAINTS
THUS THE STORY WILL CONTINUE TO THRIVE
TICKETS WILL BE AT A PREMIUM

WELL WE KNOW NOW
WELL WHAT CAN YOU DO
WELL WHAT DO YOU KNOW
WELL WHEN DID HE EVER REFUSE
WELL YOU CAN HAVE A TREE
WELL YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING
WELL YOU DON'T HAVE TIME
WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE A POINT
WE LOST A BOY
WE LOST OUR COMPOSURE TOWARDS THE INTERVAL HE SAID
WE LOST OUT A LITTLE BIT
WE LOST TO A POOR TEAM
WE MADE A WORLD RECORD TOGETHER
WE MAKE GOOD WEAPONS
WE MAKE THIS OFFER TO THE PARLIAMENT
WE MAY MAKE A SHORT TERM APPOINTMENT
WE MAY NEED TO TAKE SOME VERY RADICAL MEASURES
WE MEET AGAIN IN BERLIN
WE MIGHT BE BACK NEXT YEAR
WE MIGHT NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN
WE MUST ALL PLAY OUR PART
WE MUST CONVINCE THE CITIZENS
WE MUST DO SOMETHING
WE MUST DO THAT
WE MUST DO WELL IN THAT
WE MUST GET THE THREE POINTS
WE MUST IMPROVE OUR RELATIONS WITH GOVERNMENT
WE MUST IMPROVE OUR RELATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT

WE NEED TO THINK
WE NEED TO TIGHTEN UP
WE NEVER AGREED TO IT
WE NEVER GOT OFF THE BUS
WE NEVER PLAYED AT ALL
WE NEVER PUBLICISE IT
WE NEVER SAID THAT WE WOULD WALK THROUGH THE THIRD DIVISION
WE NOW HAVE A MOMENT OF HOPE
WE NOW HAVE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE LEAGUE
WENT ON SALE
WE OFFERED SOMETHING DIFFERENT
WE ONLY LOST THE THIRD GOAL
WE OPENED UP AND EVERYTHING WAS GONE
WE OPERATE AS A SCOTTISH COMPANY
WE OWE IT TO THE PUBLIC OF STRATHCLYDE
WE PLAYED BETTER AFTER THE BREAK
WE PLAYED SO WELL AT TIMES
WE PLAYED THEM OFF THE PITCH
WE PLAYED TOO DEEPLY
WE PLAYED WELL AT ABERDEEN THOUGH WE LOST
WE PUT OUR BID IN LAST NIGHT
WE'RE ALL FAMILY MEN WITH CHILDREN
WE'RE ALL GOING TO TAKE A HOLIDAY
WE'RE ALL IN A STATE OF SHOCK
WE'RE ALL INVOLVED IN CREATING THE WORK
WE'RE ALL INVOLVED IN DECIDING WHERE IT GOES
WE'RE ALL PAYING FOR IT
WE REALLY ARE A TEAM
WE REALLY NEED RESEARCH TO HELP WITH THAT
WE'RE AT HOME WHICH IS IMPORTANT
WE RECKON WE CAN DO VERY WELL
WE RECOGNISE IT AS A KEY AREA
WE RECOGNISE THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF GOLF IN ATTRACTING VISITORS
WE RECORDED IT AT OUR OWN EXPENSE

WE'RE DETERMINED TO ESTABLISH THE FACTS
WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE OUR PARTY
WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT IT
WE'RE GOING TO REBUILD
WE'RE GOING TO SEE A GOVERNMENT IN A HURRY
WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE EXTREME WEATHER
WE'RE GOING TO SLEEP
WE REGRET THAT THEY'RE BROUGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE
WE REGRET THAT THEY WERE BROUGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE
WE'RE HOPEFULLY GOING TO ACT AS A CATALYST FOR THAT
WE'RE IN A STATE OF SHOCK AND DISBELIEF
WE'RE IN ENGLAND FOR THE TIME BEING
WE'RE IN SHOCK
WE'RE IN THE PREMIER DIVISION AND WE INTEND TO STAY THERE
WE'RE INTO THAT BUILD UP NOW
WE'RE JUST A FAMILY WORKING HARD WORKING SEVEN DAYS A WEEK
WE'RE JUST DELIGHTED TO BE BACK ON TOP
WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR HER REACTION
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE CITIZENS THEATRE THE LYCEUM
WE'RE LOOKING FOR JUSTICE
WE'RE LOOKING FOR UNITY IN THE COUNCIL
WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO IT AS DOES THE GOVERNMENT
WE REMAIN CONFIDENT THAT DANNY IS STILL ALIVE
WE'RE NOT AN EMPLOYMENT AGENCY
WE'RE NOT COMPARING LIKE WITH LIKE
WE'RE NOT EITHER OF THOSE THINGS
WE'RE NOT GETTING INVOLVED
WE'RE NOT REALLY COMMENTING ON THAT
WE'RE NOT SEEING AN IMAGE OF THE PERSON HE SAID
WE'RE NOT TAKING ANY RISKS
WE'RE NOT THAT BAD
WE'RE NOT THE TOURIST BOARD
WE'RE NOT TRAVEL AGENTS
WE'RE OBVIOUSLY DISTURBED BY THIS CASE
WE'RE ONLY TAKING ON A COUPLE JUST NOW
WE'RE ON OUR WAY
WE'RE PLAYING AWAY FROM HOME AND THAT'S IT
WE REPRESENT A WIDE RANGE OF SOCIETY
WE'RE STILL HOPEFUL OF CONCLUDING THE DEAL
WE'RE STILL IN TALKS AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL CONTINUE
WE'RE STILL PAYING THE PRICE FOR THAT
WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT IT
WE'RE STILL TALKING WITH A FEW PEOPLE
WE'RE STILL THE ONLY ONES IN THE HIGH STREET

WERE THEY UNDER AGE
WE'RE TRYING TO GET ROUNDED PERFORMERS
WE'RE TRYING TO LESSEN THE STIGMA
WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO BEING A GOOD TEAM
WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO MAKING IT IN EUROPE
WE'RE VERY EXCITED AND CHALLENGED BY THE PROJECT
WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE THESE NEW PRODUCTS TO FOCUS ON
WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN OPENING UP IN GERMANY
WE'RE VERY PLEASED ABOUT THE VERDICT
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF HIM AND HIS ACHIEVEMENT
WE'RE VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT IT
WE'RE VERY VERY EXCITED
WE'RE VERY VERY HAPPY
WE'RE WORKING ON IT NIGHT AND DAY
WE RUN WITHIN THE LAW
WE SAID IT WILL HAPPEN ONE NIGHT
WE SAID WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WE SEE LITTLE SIGN OF IMPROVEMENT
WE SEE THE RAPID REACTION FORCE AS THE WAY AHEAD
WE SHALL BE READY FOR RANGERS
WE SHALL BE VICTORIOUS
WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED
WE SHALL NOT DO THAT
WE SHALL NOT FORGET HIM
WE SHALL RELY ON HUMAN BEINGS
WE SHOULD ALL BE GRATEFUL
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO COPE
WE SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF MANAGING IT THOUGH
WE SHOULD BE CLEAR ABOUT THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT
WE SHOULD BE REWARDED FOR PRODUCING
WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO KEEP HIM IN
WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING AT A STROKE
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN REWARDED FOR PRODUCING
WE SHOULD HAVE GONE SOLO
WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
WE SHOULD HAVE NO MORE PROBLEMS
WE SHOULD JUST SAY NO
WE SHOULD KEEP THIS RECENT ASSAULT IN PERSPECTIVE
WE SHOULD NOT BE COMPLACENT
WE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED
WE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED AT THAT
WE SHOULD NOT BRING HIM INTO A DISPUTE
WE SHOULD NOT WORRY ABOUT OTHER PLAYERS
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A RUSH TO JUDGMENT
WE SHOULD RECOGNISE OTHERS HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB
WE SHOULD RECOGNISE THAT OTHERS HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB
WE SHOULD SAVOUR THIS BECAUSE IT'S UNLIKELY EVER TO HAPPEN AGAIN
WE SHOWED A LOT OF SKILL IN THE FINAL QUARTER
WE SHOWED SOME SPIRIT AGAINST NEWCASTLE
WE SPEAK ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE
WE SPOKE ABOUT A FEW PEOPLE
WE STARTED FROM SCRATCH
WE STARTED TO STRUGGLE WITH EACH OTHER TOWARDS THE END
WE STARTED WITH THAT
WESTERN COUNTRIES CONDEMNED THE CONDUCT OF THE POLL
WE STILL DON'T KNOW
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED
WE STILL HAVE A LONG LONG WAY TO GO
WE STILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THAT

WHENEVER WE HEARD ABOUT THIS DECISION WE PROTESTED
WHEN GERMANY PLAYED THERE RECENTLY THE MATCH TOOK PLACE IN THE NEW STADIUM
WHEN HE CAME TO SEE ME ON MONDAY
WHEN HE GOT UP HE WAS HIT AGAIN
WHEN HE TOOK OVER IT REALLY TOOK OFF
WHEN IS IT EVER ANYTHING ELSE
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT THIS IS A JOB
WHEN IT HAPPENED HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT
WHEN IT IS READY IT WILL BE SIGNED
WHEN I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD I USED TO DO LIKE THIS
WHEN I WAS TRAINING
WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE BEACH BOYS AND BRIAN WILSON
WHEN SHE RETURNED IT WAS A WRECK
WHEN SHE WENT OFF IT WAS QUITE AMAZING

WHICH BRINGS US TO THE QUESTION OF MONEY
WHICH BRINGS US TO THE SCOTTISH CONNECTION
WHICH CAN HAPPEN ANY TIME

WINNING A MEDAL IS A DREAM
WINNING MEANWHILE IS HEADED BACK TO NEW YORK CITY
WISH I COULD BE THERE ON SUNDAY IN PERSON BUT I CAN'T
WITH ACTORS IT IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
WITH HIM ARE THE SYMBOLS OF HIS FAITH
WITHIN MONTHS HE WAS A PART TIME TRIBUNAL CHAIRMAN
WITHIN SIX MINUTES THEY WERE TWO GOALS DOWN
WITHIN THREE DAYS HE WAS DEAD
WITHOUT APPROVAL THE SPORT WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP
WITHOUT DOUBT THE DEBATE ON EDUCATION IS WELCOME
WITHOUT DOUBT THEY CAN WIN THE TITLE
WITHOUT RULES THE ELECTIONS COULD NOT GO AHEAD HE STRESSED
WITH PIERRE YOU CAN NEVER BE SURE
WITH THIS LINE UP THEY DIDN'T NEED TO BE
WITH US WE JUST WANT THEM TO RESPOND
WOMEN REPORTED MORE DEPRESSION THAN MEN
WOMEN WERE MOSTLY NOTABLE BY THEIR ABSENCE
WORDS ARE NOT ENOUGH
WORDS WERE NOT REQUIRED
WORKERS WILL NOW BE BALLOTED ON THE OFFER
WORK HAS STARTED
WORKING WITH HIM IS LIKE WORKING WITH MYSELF
WORK IS UNDER WAY TO CREATE A STUDIO IN INVERNESS
WORLD LEADERS EXPRESSED THEIR SYMPATHY
WORRY CAN HAVE THAT EFFECT ON SOME CITIZENS
WORSE STILL HE MIGHT BE SINGING LADY IN RED
WORSE STILL IT CAN BE INFECTIOUS
WOULD HE BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH THAT
WOULD HE EVER GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING
WOULD IT BE GOOD FOR THE NATIONWIDE LEAGUE
WOULD IT REALLY BE GOOD TO SHORTEN IT
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE
WOULD SHE REMEMBER THE MUSIC
WOULD THAT BE FOR MEN AND WOMEN
WOULD THEY WORK TOGETHER AGAIN
WOULD YOU HAVE EVER BELIEVED THAT WAS POSSIBLE
WOULD YOU PAY TO COME AND SEE IT
WOULD YOU TAKE THEM
WRITING HAS DIMINISHED IN VALUE
WRONG DECISIONS ADDRESS IN FUL
YEARS AGO IT WAS REALLY QUITE SIMPLE

YET FOR MY MONEY HE WAS NOT THE MAN OF THE MATCH
YET FOR THE MONEY HE WAS NOT THE MAN OF THE MATCH
YET HE CHOSE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
YET HE LEFT A FEW DAYS LATER
YET HE REMAINS CONFIDENT ENOUGH
YET IT DOES NOT LOSE APPEAL
YET IT IS ALL FOR TWO GOOD CAUSES
YET IT IS UNLIKELY TO BE EITHER FULL OR FINAL
