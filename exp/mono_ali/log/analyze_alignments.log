The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 44.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 56.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 2.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 34.5 hours of data, or 19.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 0.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (18,25.4,66)
