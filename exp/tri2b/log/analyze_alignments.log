The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 41.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 58.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 1.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 34.5 hours of data, or 20.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 1.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (7,13.9,40)
