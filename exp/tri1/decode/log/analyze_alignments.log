The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 43.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 58.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 3.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 8.7 hours of data, or 4.9 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 1.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (13,25.1,85)
