p225_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p225_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p225_027 SO IS THAT IT THEN
p225_028 DO I HAVE A FAVOURITE
p225_030 PEOPLE COME INTO THE BORDERS FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE BACKGROUND
p225_035 A HOSTILE BID IS PREVENTED FOR ANOTHER NINE MONTHS
p225_040 YOU'D BETTER BELIEVE IT
p225_062 I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THEM TODAY THOUGH
p225_065 THERE IS NO PRESSURE ON US
p225_067 THANKFULLY MR CAMPBELL WAS ABLE TO HELP
p225_072 WHAT KIND OF MAN DOES THAT MR DICK
p225_073 SO DID SHE MEET HIM
p225_083 WESTERN COUNTRIES CONDEMNED THE CONDUCT OF THE POLL
p225_084 HE IS DELIGHTED AND HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE
p225_086 IN FACT HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THE FIELD
p225_108 MR CHISHOLM SAID THE MOVE WAS MADE ON THE ADVICE OF CONSULTANTS
p225_116 YESTERDAY THE COMPANY REPORTED A FURTHER DOWNTURN IN PROFITS
p225_122 I DIDN'T FEEL UNDER ANY PRESSURE
p225_126 THE SQUAD IS TOO SMALL
p225_135 WE HAVE SEEN A COPY OF THE REPORT
p225_141 DRUGS ARE USED A LOT AT THE FISHING
p225_142 WELL YOU CAN HAVE A TREE
p225_150 BUT HE STRESSED THAT THE PARTNERSHIP IS NOT A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY
p225_151 NOTHING HAS BEEN PUT INTO ACTION
p225_153 WE HAVE A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH
p225_176 TREATMENT IS NOT AN ISSUE WITH THESE PEOPLE
p225_192 HOWEVER THIS IDEA IS NEVER DEVELOPED
p225_202 THE OCCASION WAS THE NEW LABOUR CONFERENCE IN BRIGHTON LAST YEAR
p225_221 IT'S ALL CHANGE AT KILMARNOCK
p225_242 THE SINGER IS EXPECTED TO BE IN HOSPITAL FOR SEVERAL DAYS
p225_248 DOES THAT PUT PRESSURE ON US
p225_254 THE PROBLEM WAS A SOCIAL PROBLEM
p225_274 WE HAVE NOT REACHED THE POINT OF NO RETURN
p225_275 SIMILAR MEASURES ARE EXPECTED IN ENGLAND AND WALES
p225_281 THEY WERE NOT AT THE PROPERTY YESTERDAY
p225_296 IT GOES BACK A LONG WAY
p225_300 I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT
p225_301 I MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
p225_302 THREE HOURS LATER THE MAN WAS FREE
p225_319 THERE'S STILL A BIT TO GO
p225_323 IT IS A COURT CASE
p225_330 WE ARE A PEACEFUL PEOPLE
p225_337 BUT THEY HAVE THE SOUND
p225_349 HOW DO YOU TAKE THEM AWAY
p225_355 HER HUSBAND WAS VERY CONCERNED THAT IT MIGHT BE FATAL
p225_365 YOU DID NOT SEE IT
p225_366 IT IS LINKED TO THE ROW OVER PROPOSED CHANGES AT SCOTTISH BALLET
p226_010 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
p226_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p226_016 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
p226_017 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
p226_028 SUGGESTIONS OF THE ACTION BEING A PUNISHMENT WERE DISMISSED
p226_030 BECAUSE WE DO NOT NEED IT
p226_040 IT WAS CLEAR
p226_042 OF COURSE ON TUESDAY UNITED WERE BEATEN DESPITE THIS
p226_043 IS THERE A NEW WAY FORWARD
p226_050 YESTERDAY HE HAD A CHILLING WARNING FOR THE GAME IN SCOTLAND
p226_055 HOWEVER HE WILL NOW HAVE TO WAIT FOR HIS CHANCE TO IMPRESS
p226_056 FOR THE MEANTIME THOUGH THE SIGNS ARE GOOD
p226_064 IT IS NOT GREAT ART
p226_066 ART IS EXTRA
p226_067 IT'S A MATTER OF BALANCE
p226_090 NEW ZEALAND RUGBY IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
p226_100 THEY WERE UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE FROM THE OTHER CLUBS
p226_108 THAT TIME IS NOT NOW HOWEVER
p226_109 OIL EMBARGO ENDORSED
p226_111 IT WAS AN ADVENTURE
p226_116 IT IS NORMAL
p226_131 I WAS FURIOUS
p226_132 CHILD ABUSE IS A DREADFUL THING
p226_138 THE WHOLE THING OF DOING THE MOVIE WAS A RISK
p226_139 I AM NOW UNEMPLOYED
p226_140 THEY MADE SUCH DECISIONS IN LONDON
p226_141 OUR INTENTIONS ARE REAL
p226_144 POLICE COULD NOT SAY IF THE TWO INCIDENTS WERE CONNECTED
p226_145 ON FRIDAY THE HEADTEACHER AND DEPUTY HEADTEACHER APPEARED AT THE DOOR
p226_149 IN THIS CASE THE FARMER HAD ACTUALLY GIVEN PERMISSION
p226_154 INITIAL REPORTS SAID THE AIRCRAFT HAD EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF POWER
p226_158 WE WILL TURN THE CORNER
p226_171 A HELPLINE NUMBER IS PUBLISHED AT THE END OF THIS ARTICLE
p226_176 IF THAT'S THE CASE HE WILL STRUGGLE
p226_178 MR DOCHERTY SAID THE WHOLE FAMILY WAS SHOCKED
p226_186 IT JUST CAME INTO MY HEAD THAT DAY
p226_189 THE WHOLE PROCESS IS A VICIOUS CIRCLE AT THE MOMENT
p226_190 SUDDENLY THE RUGBY WORLD HAD CHANGED
p226_193 THE APPEAL TRIBUNAL WILL GIVE ITS DECISION AT A LATER DATE
p226_208 I DON'T WANT TO USE IT
p226_221 FRIENDS OF THE EARTH SCOTLAND LAST NIGHT WELCOMED THE ANNOUNCEMENT
p226_229 I'D NEVER SEEN A PLAY ABOUT ME
p226_230 THE CHARITY ALSO HAS A PROJECT IN MOSCOW IN RUSSIA
p226_233 HER CONDITION WAS YESTERDAY DESCRIBED AS CRITICAL BUT STABLE
p226_238 HOSPITALS ARE FOR THE ILL
p226_241 THEY ARE ALL BRIGHT AND DIFFERENT
p226_242 IT'S ONLY FAIR
p226_244 IT IS LINKED TO THE ROW OVER PROPOSED CHANGES AT SCOTTISH BALLET
p226_247 WE DID NOT COMPETE WITH ANY OTHER LOCAL FARMER
p226_249 I SHOULD THINK SO TOO
p226_258 THAT'S WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE AND SET THE PATTERN OF THE MATCH
p226_265 THE WORK BETWEEN THE MUSICIANS AND THE FIRE IS VERY IMPORTANT
p226_266 THE WARNING IS TIMELY
p226_276 IT'S A WAY OF LIFE
p226_291 IT DEPENDS ON THE INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE
p226_294 THE RESULTS ARE SOMETIMES CONTENTIOUS
p226_299 THERE WAS NO HINT OF SCANDAL
p226_305 A POLICE INQUIRY BEGAN ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE GENERAL ELECTION
p226_311 I WAS CONCERNED WITH THE WAY THEY TRIED TO JUSTIFY HIS ACTIONS
p226_312 IT WASN'T JUST THE CHARACTER AND ENERGY OF THE PLAYING
p226_317 IT'S ABOUT MY TIME AS A GUITARIST
p226_320 THE HOME TEAM HAD AN AMAZING START
p226_321 MY BODY IS CLEARLY CAPABLE
p226_328 THAT'S THE LAW OF THE LAND
p226_332 I AM SO UPSET
p226_342 THREE YEARS AGO HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
p226_344 HE ALSO INSISTED THAT NO CONCESSIONS HAD BEEN MADE TO THE FRENCH
p226_349 HE'S BEEN THE KEY TO EVERYTHING
p226_351 THIS IS A SECTOR IN OVERALL DEFICIT AND URGENT ACTION IS REQUIRED
p226_352 HIS CONTRACT WAS THEN NOT RENEWED
p226_367 EQUITY DECLINED TO COMMENT
p226_368 ALL THE INVESTMENT IS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE PUBLIC SECTOR
p227_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p227_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p227_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p227_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p227_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION IN THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p227_025 MEETINGS WILL ALSO REMAIN PRIVATE
p227_029 THIS IS A CENTRAL ISSUE
p227_030 NONETHELESS THE OVERALL PICTURE IS HEALTHY
p227_039 AMONG THEM ARE MANY CRIMINALS
p227_040 YESTERDAY HE WAS BUSY IN HIS OFFICE
p227_043 I'D COME BACK FROM LONDON
p227_046 THERE WAS NO SAFETY NET
p227_047 THE CASTING OF HER HUSBAND WAS AN ACCIDENT
p227_048 WE HAVE TO LOOK BEYOND THE VERY SHORT TERM
p227_050 THAT IS VERY HARD ALONE
p227_058 DO I HAVE A FAVOURITE
p227_062 THEY HAVE TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION
p227_066 STRATHCLYDE POLICE HAVE APPEALED FOR WITNESSES
p227_068 HE HAD BEEN A SINGER
p227_069 THEY WOULD NOW BE ABLE TO LOOK FORWARD WITH CONFIDENCE
p227_074 EVEN THE ONE SHE LOVED
p227_077 I FIRST MET HIM LAST SUMMER
p227_084 POTIONS SAID HE WOULD DRIVE
p227_089 YOU MIGHT NOT MAKE IT
p227_093 CLARK WAS DESPERATE TO RETURN TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
p227_094 THEIR ATTITUDE IS ALL WRONG
p227_098 IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE A LENGTHY SERIES OF CLINICAL TRIALS
p227_112 IT HAS REMOVED A BIT OF GUILT
p227_122 SO DID SHE MEET HIM
p227_125 YOU'VE GOT TO BE VIGILANT
p227_129 AND I HAVE SOME ADVICE FOR MY OLD FRIEND
p227_130 HE IS A GREAT ADDITION TO OUR TEAM
p227_132 I FELT HE WAS EXCELLENT
p227_135 WE COULD EASILY HAVE LOST THAT GAME
p227_136 THIS IS A LIMITED MARKET
p227_141 HE'S NOT A CELTIC MAN
p227_147 THERE'S ONLY ONE TEAM IN AYRSHIRE
p227_148 IT WAS DEPLOYED IN THE GULF WAR
p227_155 IT WAS A FUNNY FEELING
p227_159 HE WAS IN GREAT SPIRITS
p227_160 SEVEN PEOPLE WERE LATER DETAINED BY POLICE
p227_164 THERE IS NO SIGNATURE ON THIS DOCUMENT
p227_168 WAS IT THE WIFE
p227_178 I'M JUST GOING TO HIT THE SHOT
p227_196 IT WILL BE REVIEWED IN THE HERALD TOMORROW
p227_201 THIS YEAR IT WILL AMOUNT TO A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS
p227_204 THIS WILL BE OUR NEW BEGINNING
p227_210 THIS IS A HOLY PLACE
p227_213 WHAT ARE YOU NOT GOOD AT
p227_220 THERE IS NO QUICK FIX
p227_230 HE MUST GET TO KNOW HIMSELF
p227_235 IT WAS A MISERABLE AFTERNOON IN FIFE
p227_237 WE CAN CERTAINLY BUILD ON THIS
p227_251 THEY WERE IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME
p227_258 NATO WAS NOT A LOVE AFFAIR
p227_259 WE LOST OUR COMPOSURE TOWARDS THE INTERVAL HE SAID
p227_268 DO I THINK ABOUT THEM OFTEN
p227_272 I SHOULD THINK SO TOO
p227_287 THEY CAN LEAVE AT ANY TIME
p227_290 IT WOULD CREATE A SCOTTISH SECRETARY WITH A LOT OF WEIGHT
p227_305 THERE WAS A FINAL REVEALING DETAIL ABOUT THE BROADCAST
p227_307 SIZE IS NOT THE ISSUE
p227_310 WE ARE NOT INCREASING THE NUMBER
p227_314 AND THAT CULTURE IS EVERYWHERE IN DUBLIN
p227_317 IT GOES BACK A LONG WAY
p227_323 IF YOU CAN RUN A COMPUTER YOU CAN TALK TO THE WORLD
p227_324 MCNAUGHTON WAS NOT SO SURE
p227_326 THE DEALER IS ON NOTICE
p227_329 HE WOULD HELP ME WITH THE FORM
p227_343 THAT DECISION WILL BE MADE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS
p227_348 IN THE OLD DAYS IT WAS EASY
p227_353 IN HIS ABSENCE THE COUNCIL ADOPTED THE CHANGE
p227_361 A REPORT IS EXPECTED NEXT MONTH
p227_363 WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE NEWS
p227_377 IT WAS FORCED TO DIVERT
p227_388 THERE IS NO DEAL AS YET
p227_389 IN DUE COURSE THE DEAL WAS DONE
p227_400 HOWEVER THERE IS AN ISSUE ISN'T THERE
p228_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p228_010 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
p228_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
p228_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p228_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p228_024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
p228_027 BECAUSE WE DO NOT NEED IT
p228_036 THE PROBLEM IS THE PITCH
p228_045 FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE ORDER IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN PRISON
p228_047 WE'RE IN THE PREMIER DIVISION AND WE INTEND TO STAY THERE
p228_050 HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE BUILT BY NEXT YEAR
p228_055 HOWEVER HE WILL NOW HAVE TO WAIT FOR HIS CHANCE TO IMPRESS
p228_057 FOR THE MOMENT THAT IS THE RESULT OF THE X-RAY
p228_064 SCOTLAND HAD GREAT ASSETS
p228_068 AND IF HE HADN'T BECOME A MUSICIAN
p228_071 THE SCRIPT WAS FUNNY
p228_073 SOUNDS LIKE THE SIXTH SENSE
p228_074 PAINFUL BUT ONLY BECAUSE IT'S TRUE
p228_081 PEOPLE MUST REMAIN VIGILANT
p228_082 TODAY SHE HAS BEEN RELEASED
p228_087 CERTAINLY THE TALIBAN REGIME IS FINISHED
p228_089 EVERY TIME I PLAY I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR REACTION
p228_106 CHILDREN SHOULD BE GIVEN THE SAME AMOUNT OF RIGHTS AS ADULTS
p228_108 A YEAR AGO SHE WAS JUST A JUNIOR MINISTER AT THE TREASURY
p228_113 FOR THESE PEOPLE THE RULING IS VERY WELCOME
p228_115 THE EYE WAS BADLY CLOSED ON SUNDAY
p228_117 IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE A LENGTHY SERIES OF CLINICAL TRIALS
p228_120 I DON'T WANT TO USE THE TERM
p228_135 BUCKINGHAM PALACE SAID THE APPOINTMENT WAS A MATTER FOR THE PRINCE
p228_150 HAD SHE ENJOYED THE EXPERIENCE
p228_155 IT OPENS THE DOOR TO THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE
p228_157 THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY IN A TORNADO IS ENORMOUS
p228_161 WE ALSO ENJOYED A LOT OF SUPPORT
p228_162 IT WAS BY THE NUMBERS
p228_168 I'VE PUT MY OWN MONEY INTO THIS PROJECT
p228_178 THEY MIGHT BE BROKEN BUT THEY ARE NOT DEFEATED
p228_185 I TOOK THE GUN
p228_187 THEY WILL RUN A MILE
p228_193 IT WAS AN ODD AFFAIR IN MANY RESPECTS
p228_195 WE TALK ABOUT MR MICHAEL JOHNSON AND HE IS AWESOME
p228_198 BUT A FINAL DECISION WILL NOT BE TAKEN UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTIONS
p228_199 THE APPEAL TRIBUNAL WILL GIVE ITS DECISION AT A LATER DATE
p228_200 I WANTED TO PUT MYSELF ON THE LINE
p228_210 THEY'VE GOT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE WAY
p228_216 THAT WILL BE VITAL
p228_217 EVEN A SHOPPING TRIP WAS A CAUSE FOR EXCITEMENT
p228_225 WOMEN WERE MOSTLY NOTABLE BY THEIR ABSENCE
p228_231 HE IS SEVERE
p228_244 IN SHORT THE SCOTTISH EXCESS IS NOT DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY
p228_255 THAT'S WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE AND SET THE PATTERN OF THE MATCH
p228_258 THEY ARE REAL
p228_265 PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE I HAVEN'T FINISHED THE FIRST TWO RACES
p228_268 I WAS RUBBISH
p228_272 THE DECISION WAS ANNOUNCED AT ITS ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN DUNFERMLINE
p228_288 IT BECAME A BOOK BY ITSELF
p228_290 GRAEME WAS PREPARED
p228_291 WITHIN MONTHS HE WAS A PART-TIME TRIBUNAL CHAIRMAN
p228_294 THEY ARE WRONG
p228_295 IT IS NO COUNTRY FOR A MAN OR WOMAN OF LETTERS
p228_300 WE WANT TO PLAY AT THE WORLDS
p228_302 IS THERE ON HIS HANDS
p228_303 THIS WASN'T THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
p228_304 IT'S NOT EVEN FINISHED
p228_315 IT'S NOT LONG ENOUGH
p228_317 IT WAS NO SECRET THAT I WANTED TO SIGN HIM
p228_323 YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH ALL AGE GROUPS
p228_326 IT IS A SIGN OF HOPE
p228_328 IT HAS MOVED ON IN THE LAST WEEK
p228_335 A GREAT DEAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED
p228_337 IN THE EARLY DAYS I WAS OBSESSED WITH WORKING IN THE THEATRE
p228_352 I EXPECTED THESE KIND OF QUESTIONS
p228_353 IT SHOULD BE AN ENJOYABLE AND CHALLENGING PERIOD OF THEIR LIVES
p228_362 IT TOOK ABOUT AN HOUR FOR THE GAS TO CLEAR
p228_369 THERE IS NO SIGNATURE
p229_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p229_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p229_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p229_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p229_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p229_026 HE SAID THE MATTER HAD BEEN NEGLECTED IN THE PAST
p229_032 BECAUSE WE DO NOT NEED IT
p229_033 AND WE HAVE A SINGER
p229_046 BUT IT TOOK A LOT OF BOTTLE
p229_052 THE WHOLE OF SOUTHERN AFRICA IS IN THE GRIP OF AIDS
p229_054 YESTERDAY HE HAD A CHILLING WARNING FOR THE GAME IN SCOTLAND
p229_057 SHE'S A SPY
p229_060 AND A FILM MAKER WAS BORN
p229_061 ART IS EXTRA
p229_065 IT IS LIKE A RIVER RUNNING BY MY HOME
p229_069 FERGUSON SHOULD TAKE NOTE
p229_077 TWO ISRAELI CABINET MINISTERS WERE IN THE BUILDING AT THE TIME
p229_091 WE MUST LOOK FORWARD
p229_098 SHE'S GOT TO SAY SOMETHING
p229_102 THE COURT HEARD HE DROVE INTO THE PATH OF A CAR
p229_108 I DIDN'T PLAY WELL LAST YEAR
p229_115 I CAME TO COMPLETE
p229_128 THE WHOLE PROCESS IS A VICIOUS CIRCLE AT THE MOMENT
p229_140 THEY TOOK A RISK
p229_145 THIS REPRESENTS A TOUGH GAME FOR US
p229_146 I WAS THE LAST MAN TO TOUCH THE BALL
p229_152 WE JUST HAD A GO
p229_153 HE FELT THAT EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID ABOUT ASYLUM SEEKERS WAS NEGATIVE
p229_155 HE SETS THE NATURE OF HIS PARLIAMENT IN A SIMPLE REALISTIC CONTEXT
p229_156 INITIAL REPORTS SAID THE AIRCRAFT HAD EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF POWER
p229_162 IT'S A PROBLEM BUT IT CANNOT BECOME AN EXCUSE
p229_165 HE THEN ASKED IF HE COULD HAVE HER SEAT AND SHE REFUSED
p229_169 WAS THIS ELEMENT ALWAYS THERE
p229_173 A LABOUR INSIDER SAID IT WAS FAR TOO CLOSE TO CALL
p229_175 MILITARY ACTION IS THE ONLY OPTION WE HAVE ON THE TABLE TODAY
p229_178 CUSTOMERS FOR THE PANELS INCLUDE THE NATIONAL TRUST FOR SCOTLAND
p229_179 IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR A FATHER ANYWAY AND I WAS FOREVER GRATEFUL
p229_181 DOES THAT PUT PRESSURE ON US
p229_184 THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD FOUND A HOME
p229_185 ONE SEASON THEY MIGHT DO WELL
p229_189 THE HOTEL WAS NOW FOR SALE
p229_195 SIR JEREMY FROM GLASGOW SAID THEY HAD BEEN DELIGHTED
p229_211 IT'S THE SAME OLD STORY
p229_213 HE HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AS CAPTAIN IN HIS CAREER
p229_217 WE WILL GIVE A FORMAL RESPONSE TO THE REPORT IN DUE COURSE
p229_219 SADDAM HUSSEIN IS A DEVIL
p229_220 THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR ROLE
p229_224 I HAD DECIDED TO QUIT THE SHOW
p229_230 WHO WAS ON THE PANEL
p229_246 WE'RE IN THE PREMIER DIVISION AND WE INTEND TO STAY THERE
p229_252 MANAGER BOBBY WILLIAMSON HAS NO INJURY WORRIES
p229_255 A THOUSAND YEARS AGO THE CHURCH WAS A POWERFUL FORCE IN EUROPE
p229_257 HE WAS MY BIG BROTHER MY FATHER MY GRANDFATHER
p229_267 THE WARNING IS TIMELY
p229_269 THAT DECISION IS FOR THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT AND PEOPLE
p229_271 I AM PLEASED WITH THE RESULT AS IT WAS A POSSIBLE UPSET
p229_272 HE WAS ALSO MARRIED WITH TWO CHILDREN
p229_274 WE'RE IN SHOCK
p229_278 SHE HAS FALLEN IN LOVE WITH SCOTLAND HOWEVER
p229_280 I AM AN ESTATE AGENT
p229_286 FOR THE MOMENT THAT IS THE RESULT OF THE X-RAY
p229_287 I SAW IT AT A RUCK
p229_289 WHAT WOULD BE THE TIMETABLE FOR WITHDRAWAL
p229_305 THERE IS NO OPENNESS
p229_306 THIS IS A WAR OVER OUR HOME
p229_313 LET'S HOPE IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE
p229_314 IT'S CERTAINLY DIFFERENT
p229_315 O NEILL IS CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE
p229_323 CRUELTY IS AN ACCEPTED FEATURE OF CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS
p229_338 IT HAS MOVED ON IN THE LAST WEEK
p229_344 THEY MIGHT BE BROKEN BUT THEY ARE NOT DEFEATED
p229_362 IN ADDITION IT WAS IN BREACH OF NATURAL JUSTICE
p229_364 IT WAS FIT FOR ROYALTY
p229_377 TALKS ARE PROGRESSING
p229_381 IT DOES NOT EVEN HAVE A STAFF SHORTAGE
p229_391 A COUNCIL SPOKESMAN SAID IT HAD BEEN A CONSTRUCTIVE MEETING
p230_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p230_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p230_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p230_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
p230_016 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM THE EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
p230_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p230_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p230_028 LIFE WAS LIKE A TIMETABLE
p230_034 HE REALLY IS A LOVELY MAN
p230_041 HE LOOKS LIKE AN AFGHAN
p230_046 IF NOT HE SHOULD GO HOME
p230_050 IN TIME THE FIRST MINISTER WILL GROW IN STATURE
p230_051 I HAVE MADE THAT OFFER
p230_063 THE TOURNAMENT HAS NOW BEEN CANCELLED
p230_070 IT LOOKS LIKE A HIT
p230_078 THIS IS A TRUE STORY
p230_089 HOWEVER A DECISION SHOULD BE MADE BEFORE THE END OF AUGUST
p230_094 YOU ARE LIKE AN ANIMAL
p230_113 YOU CAN SPEND MONEY ON HOUSING
p230_120 THEY ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE NEW SETTLEMENT
p230_122 SOMETHING WILL BE DONE BY CORPORATE BODIES
p230_125 ON FRIDAY THE HEADTEACHER AND DEPUTY HEADTEACHER APPEARED AT THE DOOR
p230_138 I WAS CAUGHT OUT A LITTLE BIT
p230_146 IT WAS BY THE NUMBERS
p230_148 THIS YEAR THIS MONTH WILL BE SPECIAL FOR TORRANCE
p230_149 HOWEVER HE WAS LATER RELEASED WITHOUT CHARGE
p230_156 YOU HAVE TO ASK WHETHER THEY HAVE REALLY THOUGHT THROUGH THESE ISSUES
p230_157 THEY WILL DO THEIR OWN THING
p230_158 YOU HAD TO GO AND SEE HIM
p230_159 SO WHAT IS THE CAMPAIGN ABOUT
p230_164 OUR POSITION REMAINS THE SAME
p230_168 TO GET GOOD PEOPLE YOU NEED TO OFFER THEM ENOUGH MONEY
p230_169 ON THE MONTH THE WEAKNESS WAS ACROSS THE BOARD
p230_173 BUT HE HAS A LIFELINE
p230_177 AT THE TOP LEVEL THE SALARIES ARE FAR TOO HIGH
p230_183 THEY WILL RUN A MILE
p230_186 HE PREFERS TO PLAY FOR THEM
p230_196 NEITHER SIDE WOULD REVEAL THE DETAILS OF THE OFFER
p230_200 WE PLAYED THEM OFF THE PITCH
p230_204 THIS IS A HOLY PLACE
p230_207 WE SEE THE RAPID REACTION FORCE AS THE WAY AHEAD
p230_220 HIS SECOND WAS A BEAUTY
p230_221 WHAT DO WE WANT TO DO THAT FOR
p230_222 DOES THE NAME MATTER
p230_225 THE PRIME MINISTER WAS INFORMED ON THURSDAY
p230_234 SO FAR THE PROBLEMS HAVE OCCURRED IN THE US
p230_239 NO EVIDENCE THAT IT WAS OSAMA BIN LADEN
p230_244 HERE IS A QUESTION FOR YOU
p230_249 EMPLOYEES ARE ENTITLED TO FOLLOW THEIR CONTRACT TO THE LETTER
p230_252 THIS GIVES A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO SWITCH
p230_259 MANAGER BOBBY WILLIAMSON HAS NO INJURY WORRIES
p230_260 IN FACT WE WERE ALL OVER THE SHOP
p230_273 THAT SHOULD BE THE SUBJECT MATTER OF A PUBLIC DEBATE
p230_280 WE'RE TRYING TO GET ROUNDED PERFORMERS
p230_287 YOU GET A LOT FOR YOUR MONEY
p230_288 THANKFULLY NO-ONE ON THE BUS IS TOO BADLY HURT
p230_304 I WAS THERE FIVE MONTHS AGO
p230_306 RUGBY IS NOW JUST LIKE FOOTBALL
p230_310 WE HAVE A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH
p230_326 THAT MEANT THE SEARCH WAS UNLAWFUL
p230_328 I WOULD DO AWAY WITH THE DRESS CODE
p230_334 IT WAS ALWAYS AN OPTION
p230_336 DID IT WORK
p230_338 PUBLIC OPINION WAS SPLIT ON THE PROPOSAL
p230_340 YOU MAY HAVE A SHORT MEMORY
p230_342 IN THE OLD DAYS IT WAS EASY
p230_343 THERE WAS SOME MERIT IN THAT
p230_356 IN ADDITION CERTAIN AREAS CLOSED AT CERTAIN TIMES
p230_357 THE PROFESSOR SAID THE RESULTS WERE POSITIVE
p230_367 BUT BA SAID THE PREDICTION WAS PREMATURE
p230_379 WE WILL WIN THE ARGUMENT
p230_388 THE GOVERNMENT YESTERDAY ANNOUNCED ITS PROPOSED NEW PENSION ACCOUNT
p230_393 MOTION DESCRIBED IT AS A UNIQUE EVENT
p230_396 WHAT ARE THEY FOR
p230_398 DO THEY THINK ANYONE ELSE WANTS THEM
p230_402 I'VE NEVER SEEN A GAME LIKE IT
p230_404 IT DOES NOT EVEN HAVE A STAFF SHORTAGE
p230_406 WE'RE OBVIOUSLY DISTURBED BY THIS CASE
p230_410 THE SECOND GOAL WAS SUPERB
p230_414 IT IS THE OLD STORY
p231_001 PLEASE CALL STELLA
p231_024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
p231_027 BECAUSE WE DO NOT NEED IT
p231_041 IAIN DUNCAN SMITH IS A DECENT MAN
p231_048 THERE WAS NO SAFETY NET
p231_052 WE HAVE NOT GIVEN UP HOPE
p231_063 WHAT DO WE DO
p231_067 ONLY WATER IS CURRENTLY ALLOWED
p231_076 THAT WOULD BE TOO EASY
p231_082 IT'S SO HARD TO SHIFT
p231_092 THEIR ATTITUDE IS ALL WRONG
p231_094 YOU ARE LIKE AN ANIMAL
p231_098 WE LIVE BY THE RULE OF LAW
p231_099 TWO OF THE TEAM BECAME ILL
p231_102 IT'S NOT A QUICK FIX
p231_105 SO DID SHE MEET HIM
p231_111 NEW YEAR WILL BE VERY BUSY
p231_115 JANUARY IS A BAD TIME OF YEAR
p231_125 THAT PERIOD WAS A STRUGGLE
p231_127 THIS SHOULD BEGIN IN OCTOBER
p231_128 THAT IS FAR TOO HIGH
p231_130 IT PLANS TO RETURN TO THIS FIELD
p231_132 YESTERDAY MR HAGUE DISMISSED THE POLL
p231_135 WE MUST RECOGNISE THAT THIS OUTFIT IS UNIQUE
p231_142 IT ONLY INCREASED THE SUPPORT FOR HIM
p231_143 ANYONE CAN DO THE SUMS
p231_151 IT IS NOT NORMAL PRACTICE
p231_156 IT IS A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY
p231_163 WHAT DO WE WANT TO DO THAT FOR
p231_180 I HAVE SPOKEN TO HEAD OFFICE
p231_191 WE REPRESENT A WIDE RANGE OF SOCIETY
p231_195 ON FRIDAY THE HEADTEACHER AND DEPUTY HEADTEACHER APPEARED AT THE DOOR
p231_213 WE HAVE AN ELECTION IN EIGHT DAYS
p231_214 HE ALSO PRESENTED YOU BET
p231_222 THAT YOU CAN DO IT
p231_232 SHE DIED IN MIDDLE AGE
p231_235 THE IRONY WAS NOT LOST
p231_242 SHE TOOK THEM FOR A TERM
p231_251 WASHINGTON IS CONSUMED BY THE CRISIS
p231_255 TOURISM IS A VITAL INDUSTRY FOR SCOTLAND
p231_271 I THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BIT
p231_273 I'D NEVER RUN FOR THEM
p231_281 THEY CAN LEAVE AT ANY TIME
p231_283 YOU GET A LOT FOR YOUR MONEY
p231_284 BLAIR ALSO HAD A PENALTY
p231_286 FRANKLY WE SHOULD ALL HAVE SUCH PROBLEMS
p231_289 SHE HAS FALLEN IN LOVE WITH SCOTLAND HOWEVER
p231_290 THEY WERE ON HOLIDAY IN EGYPT
p231_292 I'VE LOST ALL CONFIDENCE
p231_294 ONCE AGAIN THEY WOULD BE WRONG
p231_301 POLICE WERE ON THE SCENE WITHIN MINUTES BUT THE KILLER HAD FLED
p231_303 I WAS JUST SO DETERMINED
p231_305 THE JUDGE WAS REALLY NICE
p231_312 I THOUGHT IT WAS MY ONLY CHANCE
p231_313 I THOUGHT HE DID VERY WELL
p231_317 THEY COME TO ENJOY THEMSELVES
p231_328 IT WILL DECIDE TODAY WHETHER HE SHOULD BE STRUCK OFF THE REGISTER
p231_330 I AM NOT SURE ABOUT THE RATE OF PROGRESS
p231_340 AT FIRST THE YOUNGSTER WAS NOT KEEN
p231_341 THE FIGURES ARE BAD BUT NOT THAT BAD
p231_346 WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE NEWS
p231_353 THE UNITS WILL NOT BE REPLACED
p231_354 NEITHER MAN HAS BEEN CHARGED
p231_357 LOOK AT THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS
p231_358 I AM A LUCKY MAN
p231_361 GLASGOW IS A FRIENDLY CITY
p231_364 IT IS NOT REAL LIFE
p231_366 THEY SHOULD TAKE THEIR MOBILE PHONES
p231_371 THE RESULT IS CALLED A PATENT
p231_375 HERE IS A WEATHER FORECAST FOR THE WEEKEND
p231_376 WE WERE GIVEN A BREAK
p231_380 WE WILL WIN THE ARGUMENT
p231_381 HAD THIS BEEN COMMON PRACTICE
p231_384 DOES IT MATTER
p231_388 INSTEAD HE WAS INFORMED TO JOIN THE LINE OF CREDITORS
p231_394 THAT'S AS GOOD AS IT GETS
p231_395 A REVIEW IS UNDER WAY
p231_398 THEY HAVE FAILED TO DELIVER
p231_411 AFTER THE MATCH DO YOU
p231_415 I REMAIN A BUYER OF THE SHARES
p231_418 THERE WILL BE WIDESPREAD SUPPORT ON ALL SIDES
p231_428 PUPILS WERE ALLOWED HOME AT LUNCHTIME
p231_429 HE IS ON THE WRONG SIDE
p231_435 I NEVER WON A PENNY THROUGHOUT MY CAREER
p231_439 THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WANT TO KNOW
p231_440 THEY SAID THEY WERE ONLY YOUNG MEN
p231_449 AND WE MIGHT GO BACK
p231_450 WE HAVE JUST GOT TO KEEP HIS FEET ON THE GROUND
p231_467 CLASSES MUST BE REDUCED BY HALF
p231_468 WAR IS NOT THE ACTION
p231_471 DENNIS WAS NOT SO SURE
p231_473 IT WAS CLEAR ON THURSDAY
p232_001 PLEASE CALL STELLA
p232_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p232_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION
p232_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p232_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p232_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p232_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p232_029 THEIR COURAGE AND THEIR HONESTY SHOULD BE RESPECTED
p232_030 THEY WERE DESCRIBED AS BEING IN A SERIOUS BUT STABLE CONDITION YESTERDAY
p232_032 THEY DID NOT REPLACE IT WITH A CONVICTION FOR CULPABLE HOMICIDE
p232_034 IT IS MARVELLOUS
p232_037 TWO OTHER MEN INCLUDING THE TAXI DRIVER WERE WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK
p232_046 THE JUDGE SAID
p232_047 IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ALI
p232_072 THAT WAS THE EASY ELECTION
p232_076 I HAD MY SUSPICIONS
p232_087 NO PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE
p232_094 THIS TIME IT WILL HAVE OPENED UP THE FIELD A LITTLE BIT
p232_116 MAYBE THIS BATTLE HAS BEEN
p232_124 THAT'S ALL RIGHT THEN
p232_126 CHILD ABUSE IS A DREADFUL THING
p232_130 OFFERED THE GOLD MEDAL HE DECLINED
p232_133 IF NOT A DEAL COULD TAKE MANY MONTHS
p232_150 SHE HAD GONE TO THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL
p232_163 IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO GET ON BOARD
p232_166 YET IT IS UNLIKELY TO BE EITHER FULL OR FINAL
p232_170 WE'VE MADE A COUPLE OF ALBUMS
p232_171 MY LIFE HAS BEEN DESTROYED
p232_182 I'VE BEEN IN TWO FINALS AND I'VE GOT A MEDAL
p232_188 FAMILY LIAISON OFFICERS ARE NOW WORKING TO SUPPORT THE FAMILY
p232_190 WE DID EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK
p232_191 I WISH I COULD SAY SOMETHING
p232_195 I WANTED TO PUT MYSELF ON THE LINE
p232_197 THE MODERN APPROACH WILL ALSO BE REFLECTED IN THE TERMS OF ADDRESS
p232_200 HE'S NOT WRITTEN AS A TERRIBLY EXCITING PERSON IN THE BOOK
p232_204 WE SEE THE RAPID REACTION FORCE AS THE WAY AHEAD
p232_205 IT'S A MIXTURE OF EVERYTHING
p232_206 WE'RE NOT SEEING AN IMAGE OF THE PERSON HE SAID
p232_207 I DON'T WANT TO USE IT
p232_208 NOW IT'S ALL RIGHT
p232_210 THAT'S THE DAY JOB
p232_215 HIS THIRD GOAL WAS SUPERB
p232_218 HE SEEMED TO LOSE HIS FOCUS
p232_219 HE SAID THAT HEALTHY EATING WAS HIGH ON THE COUNCIL AGENDA
p232_230 I AM IMMENSELY SAD
p232_233 THE TRACK IS CURRENTLY COVERED IN SNOW
p232_235 HER CONDITION WAS YESTERDAY DESCRIBED AS CRITICAL BUT STABLE
p232_241 IT'S QUITE NICE
p232_242 IT'S QUITE A LINE-UP
p232_250 HE SAYS THAT HE IS NO DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER MAN
p232_251 MANAGER BOBBY WILLIAMSON HAS NO INJURY WORRIES
p232_255 IT'S A RECORD LABEL NOT A FORM OF MUSIC
p232_259 FOR THE SCOTTISH JUDGES THE AFFAIR IS VERY DELICATE AND UNIQUE
p232_263 HOWEVER THE FORCE HAS NOT YET RECEIVED A FORMAL COMPLAINT
p232_266 THEY WANT TO SHUT THE SCOTTISH OFFICE
p232_270 PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE I HAVEN'T FINISHED THE FIRST TWO RACES
p232_271 BROWN IS AN INTERESTING MAN BUT HE IS NOT DESPERATE
p232_275 LOTTERY MONEY WAS INTENDED TO BE USED FOR GOOD CAUSES
p232_281 IT'S A WAY OF LIFE
p232_284 THE RECORD COMPANIES HAVE GONE THROUGH THE FLOOR
p232_291 THEY WERE ALSO BESIDE THEMSELVES
p232_296 HE WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY GENUINE
p232_309 WE ARE NOW LOOKING AT THE DEGREES OF INJURY
p232_315 KIDS ARE TERRIBLE
p232_331 HE WAS THEN REPLACED BY ROSS
p232_341 GAELIC PROVISION CONTINUED TO BE GOOD
p232_342 THAT'S NOT EVICTION BECAUSE HE IS NOT A TENANT
p232_347 SEX OFFENDER PROGRAMMES TO BE RETAINED BY PUBLIC SECTOR
p232_353 LIKE HIS ACTING IT WAS AN ACCIDENT
p232_354 IT IS LONG GONE
p232_362 YOU MUST HAVE A GOVERNMENT AND A GOOD CIVIL SERVICE
p232_363 BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE CLOSURE OF THE EXPORT MARKET
p232_366 IT BENEFITS THE WHOLE FAMILY
p232_367 HE HAS SEEN THE PAST
p232_369 TO DO SO HE RECKONS THAT A GOOD OPENING RESULT IS ESSENTIAL
p232_371 THE SCENE IS ABOUT THIS
p232_373 MR ANDERSON WAS NOT ACTING IN THE COURSE OF HIS EMPLOYMENT
p232_377 FOR ONE VETERAN THE MEMORIES REMAIN VIVID
p232_388 MS MCNEILL WAS KILLED ON IMPACT
p232_392 BUILDING AN UNDERGROUND FOR EXAMPLE HAS PROVED A NIGHTMARE
p232_397 I LOVE THE THOUGHT OF HAVING A CRACK AT DEFENDING THE TITLE
p232_401 IT IS LEGALLY BINDING
p232_403 MY HOUSE WAS SHAKING AT THE TIME
p233_001 PLEASE CALL STELLA
p233_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
p233_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p233_016 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
p233_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p233_024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
p233_032 LAST NIGHT MR ROBERTSON SAID HE WAS DELIGHTED
p233_041 I HAVE NEVER BEEN A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL
p233_048 IT IS ALL STARTING TO COME TOGETHER
p233_054 WE ARE WORKING ON IT
p233_063 THAT COULD BE A MISTAKE
p233_064 IT WAS AN AMAZING RESULT
p233_076 WE CAN ALL MAKE A MISTAKE
p233_079 HOWEVER HE STRESSED THAT NO DECISION HAD YET BEEN MADE
p233_082 HOWEVER A RULING WILL NOT COME BEFORE NEXT WEEK
p233_096 I HAD A BIT IN HAND
p233_100 IT SHOULD BE A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT
p233_104 SHE WAS THERE FOR THE START OF THE CAMPAIGN
p233_105 HE HAS BECOME A MONSTER
p233_112 I THOUGHT IT WAS A FANTASTIC GAME
p233_117 HOLYROOD IS JUST A PART OF THE JIGSAW
p233_131 IT'S THE TRAUMATIC EVENT IN THE CHILDHOOD OF THE NATION
p233_137 I AM NOW UNEMPLOYED
p233_155 HE WILL EMERGE AS A WORLD LEADER
p233_157 THE HOME SIDE DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE
p233_159 BUT HE STRESSED THAT THE PARTNERSHIP IS NOT A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY
p233_166 SHE ALSO DEFENDED THE LORD CHANCELLOR'S EXISTING POWERS
p233_170 I WILL TELL YOU
p233_180 WE'VE MADE A COUPLE OF ALBUMS
p233_182 HE WILL FEEL THE PAIN AGAIN
p233_189 WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT CONTROLLER FATIGUE
p233_190 I WAS TOTALLY WRONG
p233_192 I'VE BEEN THERE
p233_203 IT'S A COMMISSION AND IT'S FOR WORK A YEAR'S WORK
p233_204 IT WASN'T TO BE
p233_208 IT WAS SERVED BY SHERIFF OFFICERS NOT BY THE COUNCIL
p233_209 I HAVE A COLD
p233_221 THE FBI COULD BECOME INVOLVED
p233_232 LOTTERY CASH IS RIGHTLY DEPENDENT ON GRASSROOTS APPROVAL
p233_234 MY NEIGHBOURS ARE HORRIFIED
p233_236 I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HIM
p233_244 CHAMBERS SAID HE WOULD ACCEPT THE PLACE
p233_250 THERE WASN'T A GOAL
p233_256 THE DISTINCTION IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY DOCTORS
p233_261 HE HAS ALREADY SUFFERED A GOOD DEAL OF UNWANTED ATTENTION
p233_262 IT IS ALSO VERY VALUABLE
p233_272 WE SHOWED A LOT OF SKILL IN THE FINAL QUARTER
p233_273 IMMEDIATE ACTION MUST BE TAKEN
p233_277 AND MICHAEL WAS JUST GREAT
p233_284 THEY WERE ON HOLIDAY IN EGYPT
p233_286 IT WAS NOT HARD TO FEEL SOME SYMPATHY FOR BAXTER YESTERDAY
p233_288 THEY WERE TOO HARD
p233_299 I HAVE TONIGHT RESIGNED AS A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
p233_304 DETAILS OF THE NEW VESSEL WERE GIVEN IN LONDON YESTERDAY
p233_312 WE HAVE GOT NO MONEY TO GO ANYWHERE
p233_313 THE ELECTION IS TOTAL CONFUSION AND CHAOS
p233_314 IT WILL DECIDE TODAY WHETHER HE SHOULD BE STRUCK OFF THE REGISTER
p233_315 THE PROBLEMS BEGAN A LONG TIME AGO
p233_317 WE ARE VERY STRONGLY BEHIND THE BID
p233_319 BUT NO SUCH AMENDMENT HAS BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT
p233_322 WE AGREED TO DISAGREE
p233_325 LATER IN THE DAY HE WAS FORCED TO EXPLAIN HIS POSITION
p233_327 IT ADDED TO THE SPECTACLE
p233_332 HOWEVER SHARON REJECTED THE CLAIMS
p233_336 THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE AFTER INQUIRIES FROM A NATIONAL NEWSPAPER
p233_338 NOBODY ELSE WAS WITH ME
p233_339 I'VE LEARNED FROM MY MISTAKES
p233_340 I COULD HARDLY MOVE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS
p233_355 IT IS CLEAR THAT WE MUST LEARN THE LESSONS FROM THIS OUTBREAK
p233_361 THEY HAVE NOT DONE SO THIS SEASON SO FAR
p233_373 IT WAS A HIT
p233_375 TREATMENT IS NOT AN ISSUE WITH THESE PEOPLE
p233_385 THE COMPROMISE IS ENTIRELY ON THE ARRIVAL AT THAT POSITION
p233_388 I WAS IN JAIL FOR FIVE YEARS
p233_392 HE HAS NOT CREATED A FESTIVAL RESOURCE
p234_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p234_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION
p234_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p234_010 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
p234_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
p234_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p234_016 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
p234_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p234_024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
p234_027 POLICE WERE CALLED TO THE SCENE ACCORDING TO THE WEEKEND REPORTS
p234_029 HOWEVER THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE CANCER RETURNED
p234_031 IT IS ON THE INTERNET
p234_040 WE ARE THE PARTY OF THE FUTURE
p234_044 AT THE MOMENT WE DO NOT KNOW THE EXTENT OF THEIR INJURIES
p234_053 YESTERDAY HE WAS BUSY IN HIS OFFICE
p234_055 I'VE NEVER BEEN ONE FOR COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PRESS
p234_056 THIS TREND IS LIKELY TO STRENGTHEN
p234_060 HE LOOKS AS IF HE COULD BE WORTH THE RISK
p234_067 UNTIL RECENTLY SHE WORKED AS A RECRUITMENT CONSULTANT IN LONDON
p234_076 WE CAN ALL MAKE A MISTAKE
p234_082 HOWEVER A RULING WILL NOT COME BEFORE NEXT WEEK
p234_086 HOW ARE YOU SIR
p234_093 HE IS IN THE US
p234_101 I HAD NO INTENTION OF MISLEADING ANYONE
p234_106 IN FACT HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THE FIELD
p234_112 THAT WOULD BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM
p234_113 OUR ACTION IS NOT THE END BUT THE BEGINNING OF A PROCESS
p234_114 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PLACED IN A STATE OF ALARM
p234_115 SHE IS NOT A VICTIM
p234_116 A YEAR AGO SHE WAS JUST A JUNIOR MINISTER AT THE TREASURY
p234_117 AND WE HAD A GOOD RESPONSE
p234_122 THAT ADMISSION IS NOT SURPRISING
p234_126 HE WANTED TO RECORD THE GROUP
p234_127 HOWEVER IT WAS A DIFFERENT STORY IN THE FINAL
p234_128 THE END RESULT IS THE SAME
p234_129 THREE DAYS LATER HE WAS KILLED
p234_131 HOWEVER THE BANK DENIED THAT HE WAS IN THE RUNNING
p234_132 THE PROBLEM WAS A SOCIAL PROBLEM
p234_134 IT IS NOT SO SIMPLE
p234_155 WE WANT TO GET THERE
p234_163 FRANKLY IT WAS WORTH THE BOOKING
p234_172 I HAVE HAD A GOOD LIFE
p234_177 IT IS AMBITIOUS BUT IT CAN BE ACHIEVED
p234_211 THE TRADING CONDITIONS ARE NOT GOOD
p234_217 BEING INVESTOR READY IS A GOOD START
p234_225 HER EXPERIENCE IS CERTAINLY LIMITED
p234_232 IT IS THE STRENGTH OF THE SCHOOL
p234_235 THE CONFERENCE IS THE FIRST TEST
p234_236 INDEED HE SEES A SHORTAGE OF SKILLED WORKERS ON THE HORIZON
p234_244 WHAT WAS THE MATTER FOR CONCERN
p234_245 DO I THINK ABOUT THEM OFTEN
p234_247 DID HE TRIP
p234_248 I IN THE MEANTIME HAD BEEN FAR FROM CHILLING
p234_256 THIS IS A SENSIBLE AND COMMON SENSE APPROACH
p234_257 THE MATTER IS UNDER APPEAL
p234_258 I AM DELIGHTED FOR THEM
p234_259 IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE
p234_264 SCOTLAND PLAYED A MAJOR PART IN THE PROJECT
p234_265 INVESTORS WERE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT MARGIN PRESSURE
p234_270 THIS WOULD INDICATE A SURGE IN INFLATION WAS UNLIKELY
p234_274 SO FAR THE PROBLEMS HAVE OCCURRED IN THE US
p234_286 IS OUR CHILDREN LEARNING
p234_296 THE RESULTS ARE EXPECTED WITHIN DAYS
p234_313 EVERY ONE IS A WINNER
p234_314 DRUGS ARE USED A LOT AT THE FISHING NOT JUST CANNABIS
p234_323 AND HE'S THE REAL THING
p234_324 WHAT ARE THEY FOR
p234_328 ALL OF THE MANAGEMENT HAS INVESTED IN THE FIRM
p234_331 EVERYTHING HAPPENED SO QUICKLY THAT WE WERE TAKEN BY SURPRISE
p234_338 SURELY THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT IS ENTITLED TO TAKE A VIEW ON THAT
p234_349 WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN DIVIDENDS
p234_361 WE NEVER PLAYED AT ALL
p236_010 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
p236_016 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
p236_017 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
p236_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p236_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p236_029 IT'S GOING TO HAVE A HELL OF AN EFFECT
p236_036 IF WE CANNOT SUCCEED IN THIS ENDEAVOUR THEN SO BE IT
p236_040 THE STAFF ARE AS GOOD AS ANY STAFF IN THE CITY
p236_041 I NEEDED A CHANGE A NEW CHALLENGE
p236_042 IAIN DUNCAN SMITH IS A DECENT MAN
p236_053 WE KEEP AN EYE ON IT
p236_055 WE FELT IT WAS SUFFICIENT
p236_062 I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THEM TODAY THOUGH
p236_071 IT LOOKS LIKE A HIT
p236_074 WE DID IT FOR THE JERSEY
p236_079 ON SATURDAY IT WAS MUCH THE SAME
p236_081 WE HAVE TURNED THE CORNER
p236_084 HOWEVER THE APPROACH IS NOT BELIEVED TO BE HOSTILE
p236_090 AFTER THE MATCH DO YOU
p236_092 THE VAST BULK OF ITS FUNDS ARE RUN BY ABERDEEN
p236_100 OUR HOUSE WAS VERY SMALL
p236_107 THEY WILL NOTICE A DIFFERENCE
p236_108 FOOTBALL IS A PASSION FOR MANY
p236_110 THERE'S STILL PLENTY TIME LEFT
p236_112 I'VE HEARD THIS STUFF ABOUT THE MARKETS
p236_127 THEY MADE SUCH DECISIONS IN LONDON
p236_131 WE WILL TRY TO FIND SOMEONE
p236_132 THEY COULD USE A BOOST
p236_142 IT HAS BECOME A WAY OF LIFE
p236_152 IT WOULD SEEM A NATURAL PROGRESSION
p236_155 BEING INVOLVED AT THAT LEVEL IS LIKE AN ADDICTION
p236_156 IT WAS A FUNNY FEELING
p236_161 IT IS NOT A FINANCIAL ISSUE
p236_163 SEVEN PEOPLE WERE LATER DETAINED BY POLICE
p236_169 IT OPENS THE DOOR TO THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE
p236_172 IT'S NICE TO BE NICE
p236_176 IS THERE A WAITING LIST
p236_177 DO THEY THINK ANYONE ELSE WANTS THEM
p236_179 HAD THIS BEEN COMMON PRACTICE
p236_182 ONE SEASON THEY MIGHT DO WELL
p236_201 IT SHOWS THE STRENGTH OF THE ROOTS
p236_202 HOWEVER MURRAY JOHNSTONE IS NOT ON THE MENU
p236_203 THIS YOUNGSTER IS SO EXCITING
p236_228 FROM THERE THEY CAN GO ANYWHERE
p236_231 THE COURSE HAS HELPED A LOT
p236_235 BASICALLY THEY HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE OFFER
p236_236 I AM CONSIDERED A TEENAGER
p236_245 TRUTH IS THE CHILD OF TIME
p236_246 AND THEY WERE BEING PAID
p236_249 DO I THINK ABOUT THEM OFTEN
p236_251 A SMALL NUMBER OF NEW JOBS WILL ALSO BE CREATED
p236_262 IT IS BELIEVED THE SIZE OF THE SETTLEMENT HAS NOT BEEN FINALISED
p236_265 YOU CAN FEEL AT HOME IN CHINA
p236_272 THE CAPITAL COSTS ARE MODEST
p236_273 I TOLD YOU I WAS ILL
p236_289 FRANKLY WE SHOULD ALL HAVE SUCH PROBLEMS
p236_293 STEPHEN WILL GET HIS FIRST CAP
p236_296 I SAW IT AT A RUCK
p236_305 THEY HAVE SHOWN A GREAT DESIRE AND ATTITUDE
p236_307 THE RESCUE PACKAGE IS PUBLIC MONEY
p236_308 I WAS THERE FIVE MONTHS AGO
p236_310 HIS JOB WAS NOT ADVERTISED
p236_311 WE CAN WORK ALL NIGHT
p236_327 THIS RULING IS A FARCE
p236_328 AFTER SOME DISCUSSION THEY DID
p236_333 YOU MAY HAVE A SHORT MEMORY
p236_335 THERE WAS NO TIME SCALE
p236_336 THAT DECISION HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE
p236_337 IN HIS ABSENCE THE COUNCIL ADOPTED THE CHANGE
p236_340 EVEN THE ONE SHE LOVED
p236_343 HOPEFULLY IT WILL COME FROM SOMEONE ON OUR SIDE
p236_352 ALEX FERGUSON IS THE SAME
p236_353 WHAT DO WE DO
p236_354 WHY DO IT OTHERWISE
p236_356 SO DID SHE MEET HIM
p236_360 THEY HAVE BROKEN THAT PROMISE
p236_364 SHE SAID THEY WOULD APPEAL
p236_368 IT WAS LIKE A WEEKLY WAGE
p236_371 THE PAIR ARE VERY MUCH IN LOVE
p236_372 WE USED TO KEEP OUR BUSINESS RATES
p236_376 ALL WOULD BE UNDER THREAT
p236_385 THIS BIG ISSUE IS WHETHER IT CAN BE ENFORCED
p236_388 IT BROUGHT IN NEW MANAGEMENT
p236_392 HOWEVER THE PLAYERS SHOULD HAVE A VOICE IN THESE MATTERS
p236_402 WE CAN PRODUCE A BLUEPRINT FOR FARMERS TO FOLLOW
p236_405 BUT DEMAND FOR SPACE IN EDINBURGH IS STILL STRONG
p236_408 THE TRICK IS TO TRY IT
p236_412 HE REPEATED HIS CALL FOR AN INQUIRY INTO THE POLICE RESPONSE
p236_415 I'VE GOT MY OWN IDEAS
p236_421 HE WILL BE JUDGED BY HIS ACTIONS
p236_433 HOWEVER THE DOWNTURN HAS FORCED THE OVERDRAFT REQUEST
p236_443 WE WOULD HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT

p237_072 THE END RESULT IS PRECISELY THE SAME
p237_073 THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF RACISM IN SCOTLAND
p237_082 I FIRST MET HIM LAST SUMMER
p237_085 SOMEONE WHO CARES
p237_091 TODAY I COULDN'T RUN ON IT
p237_097 I LOVE THE DOME
p237_098 I WISH I HAD PUT ON A BRIGHTER TIE
p237_100 THEY WERE OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE
p237_110 FURTHER PROTESTS ARE LIKELY
p237_112 WHO WOULD BE RIGHT
p237_113 IT'S A SHAME
p237_123 AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON HIS REPLACEMENT IS EXPECTED WITHIN THREE WEEKS
p237_126 I THOUGHT IT WAS A FANTASTIC GAME
p237_127 I'M SO ANGRY
p237_128 CHILD ABUSE IS A DREADFUL THING
p237_139 THE SCOTTISH SOCIALIST PARTY IS ALSO EXPECTED TO ATTEND

p237_205 TOMMY IS NOT A PROBLEM
p237_206 THE SISTERS ALSO BECAME THE TWO TOP PLAYERS IN THE WORLD
p237_207 HE WAS ALSO MARRIED WITH TWO CHILDREN
p237_217 HE IS SLIGHTLY CONFUSED
p237_218 SHE SHOULD NOT BE BLAMED
p237_224 HOWEVER DUNDEE DESERVED TO WIN THIS GAME
p237_233 I'D NEVER SEEN A PLAY ABOUT ME
p237_235 I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HIM
p237_244 WE ARE IN THE HAT
p237_259 YOU CAN FEEL AT HOME IN CHINA
p237_265 THERE WILL BE WIDESPREAD SUPPORT ON ALL SIDES
p237_270 SPECIAL MEASURES WERE NEEDED
p237_277 THE WORK BETWEEN THE MUSICIANS AND THE FIRE IS VERY IMPORTANT
p237_279 IT IS A CRISIS OF HUMAN RIGHTS A CRISIS OF LEADERSHIP
p237_285 IMMEDIATE ACTION MUST BE TAKEN
p237_289 SHE FAILED IN HER ACTION

p237_327 THE PARENTS WILL HAVE A GREAT TIME TOO
p237_330 LAST NIGHT HE PLEDGED TO CLEAR HIS NAME
p237_331 INSIDE THE ATMOSPHERE WAS QUIET
p237_338 THERE WAS A BIT OF URGENCY IN THE SECOND HALF
p237_341 I WOULD BE QUITE HAPPY FOR THE MONEY TO BE GIVEN BACK
p237_344 THE TRAIN WAS ON TIME
p237_348 LOOK AT THE WITNESSES
p238_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION
p238_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p238_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p238_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p238_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p238_025 SMOKING IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT
p238_032 THE STAFF ARE VERY GOOD
p238_035 OF COURSE ON TUESDAY UNITED WERE BEATEN DESPITE THIS
p238_050 THE WHOLE THING WAS FILMED IN HOLLYWOOD
p238_056 AFTER THE MATCH DO YOU
p238_059 THEY DESPERATELY WANT SOME STABILITY
p238_063 EVERYTHING ELSE IS A BONUS
p238_069 THE PARTNERSHIP WAS SET UP DURING THE SUMMER
p238_081 WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO COPE
p238_086 WE SHOULD ALL BE GRATEFUL
p238_090 HE THOUGHT SHE WAS AMAZING
p238_098 MAYBE THIS BATTLE HAS BEEN
p238_101 IT WILL TAKE A FEW YEARS BEFORE WE SEE THE FULL BENEFIT
p238_102 IT'S VERY DANGEROUS FOR MARKETS
p238_106 TALK OF A CRISIS IS ABSURD
p238_118 IT'S GOING TO BE EPIC
p238_125 HAD THIS BEEN COMMON PRACTICE
p238_126 WHAT DO THEY WANT US TO DO
p238_127 BASICALLY WE LOST THE GAME BECAUSE WE WERE OUTPLAYED
p238_131 THIS IS A SIZEABLE PART OF OUR BUSINESS
p238_132 DIVERSIONS WERE PUT IN PLACE
p238_138 MONTY IS GREAT IN HIS OWN BACKYARD
p238_146 FOUR MEETINGS HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN ARRANGED
p238_150 IT IS A VICIOUS CIRCLE
p238_155 THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AGAINST AYR
p238_156 HOPEFULLY NO-ONE WILL SUFFER TOO BADLY
p238_158 BUT HIS SPEECH WAS DELIVERED BY A SENIOR CIVIL SERVANT
p238_162 THE MILK INDUSTRY IS IN TURMOIL
p238_165 THE ARRANGEMENT WILL AVOID ANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
p238_169 I CAN SEE IT NOW
p238_172 WE CONTINUE TO HOLD THE SHARES
p238_177 THE CHANGES TOOK EFFECT FROM JUNE
p238_180 SINCE THEN THINGS HAVE IMPROVED
p238_192 THE YUGOSLAV ARMY WILL STILL BE THERE
p238_194 HE HAS HAD SUCCESS AT EVERY LEVEL
p238_200 DOES THAT PUT PRESSURE ON US
p238_203 IS OUR CHILDREN LEARNING
p238_209 MEXICO CITY WAS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE
p238_212 IT IS TIME FOR CONFESSION
p238_215 IN GENERAL TERMS THE PROPOSALS ARE VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS
p238_217 I WILL NOT TAKE PART IN EDMONTON
p238_220 FRANKLY IT WAS WORTH THE BOOKING
p238_222 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL BEYOND BELIEF
p238_223 WE WERE RIGHT TO BE AFRAID
p238_228 ARNIE IGNORES THE SUGGESTION THAT HE HAS EVER BEEN ANYWHERE ELSE
p238_247 BUT IT COULDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
p238_249 MEANWHILE THE SEARCH CONTINUES FOR FERGUSON'S REPLACEMENT
p238_252 WAS EVERYTHING DONE TO SAVE PEOPLE
p238_253 WHAT WAS THE MATTER FOR CONCERN
p238_259 ARSENAL REFUSED TO BE EVICTED
p238_263 NOT A GREAT DEAL HAS CHANGED IN THE LAST DECADE
p238_267 THE STRONG PERFORMANCE IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE
p238_273 INITIAL MARKET REACTION WAS CLOSE TO EUPHORIC
p238_275 BOBBY WILLIAMSON HAS BEEN BRILLIANT
p238_278 THE FEEDBACK FROM AUDIENCES WAS JUST SO POSITIVE
p238_279 I CAME UP THROUGH THE RANKS
p238_282 THE HAPPINESS WAS SLIGHTLY MISPLACED
p238_296 BUT THERE'S AN UPTURN IN THE SECTOR
p238_301 HOW DO YOU GET IT BACK
p238_302 WHAT ARE YOU NOT GOOD AT
p238_311 I WAS READY TO SHOOT THE DAY I READ THE SCREENPLAY
p238_313 MOVIE STARS ARE PUBLIC PROPERTY
p238_314 OUR MESSAGE TO THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE IS CLEAR
p238_316 THAT MOMENT WHEN THE MONSTER IS BEING BROUGHT TO LIFE
p238_321 WE BELIEVE A THIRD PARTY WAS INVOLVED
p238_323 THE EARLY PHYSICAL REPORTS WERE CLEAR
p238_336 THEREAFTER THEY WERE ALLOWED TO PROCEED
p238_340 TODAY WE MUST NOT REPEAT THAT MISTAKE
p238_342 HE IS THE SON OF FORMER CHAIRMAN LORD WOLFSON
p238_360 I SAW THEM LAST WEEK
p238_371 WE WILL LIKELY LOOK FOR NEW INVESTORS
p238_373 BUT YOU NEVER WON ANY GAMES
p238_381 IT WAS CYNICAL AND CALLOUS
p238_384 DO I HAVE A FAVOURITE
p238_386 WHY DO IT OTHERWISE
p238_387 PENSIONS ARE A LONG-TERM INVESTMENT
p238_390 IT'S DIFFICULT TO PUT A DATE ON
p238_392 THOSE OVERSEAS OFFICES WERE GREAT
p238_395 THE PROBLEMS ARE A RESULT OF THAT SHORTFALL
p238_406 HE ALSO LAUNCHED A NEW STRATEGY FOR THE AGENCY
p238_409 HOW ARE YOU SIR
p238_411 THIS IS A HISTORIC OCCASION
p238_427 IT TELLS THE STORY OF A WOMAN WHO HAS PROBABLY BEEN ABUSED
p238_437 WE ARE AIMING FOR EARLY MARCH
p238_454 SIMILAR MEASURES ARE EXPECTED IN ENGLAND AND WALES
p238_458 I HAVE WORKED AS A STAND-UP THERE OFTEN
p239_001 PLEASE CALL STELLA
p239_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p239_035 I MIGHT WELL HAVE DONE SO ALREADY
p239_040 AFTER THE MATCH DO YOU
p239_043 THIS MATTER HAS STILL TO COME BEFORE THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
p239_047 OF COURSE ON TUESDAY UNITED WERE BEATEN DESPITE THIS
p239_053 I REMEMBER THAT DAY WELL
p239_057 I FEEL WE MIGHT NOW HAVE THE FOUNDATIONS TO GO FORWARD
p239_058 AMONG THEM ARE MANY CRIMINALS
p239_059 THAT'S BEEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SIDES
p239_081 IN TIME THE FIRST MINISTER WILL GROW IN STATURE
p239_085 INDEED IT IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
p239_088 SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
p239_090 WHAT DO THEY WANT US TO DO
p239_095 IT WAS FUN BUT NOT A LIVING
p239_098 THE GOVERNMENT YESTERDAY ANNOUNCED ITS PROPOSED NEW PENSION ACCOUNT
p239_100 SALES ARE FALLING AFTER YEARS OF GROWTH
p239_112 TALK OF A CRISIS IS ABSURD
p239_116 I'VE HAD IT FOR THE EXAMS
p239_123 BASICALLY WE LOST THE GAME BECAUSE WE WERE OUTPLAYED
p239_125 THEY LIVED FOR THEIR CHILDREN
p239_129 WHAT FORM DID THAT TAKE
p239_130 ARE THEY FREE
p239_136 WESTERN COUNTRIES CONDEMNED THE CONDUCT OF THE POLL
p239_143 HE IS AN EXTRAORDINARY WRITER ON SO MANY LEVELS
p239_147 GORDON MARSHALL WAS OUTSTANDING AGAINST US
p239_148 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PLACED IN A STATE OF ALARM
p239_150 THE MOVE FOLLOWS A REVIEW OF THE SINGAPORE
p239_151 WHICH ISN'T A BAD IDEA
p239_152 SINCE THEN THINGS HAVE IMPROVED
p239_154 HOPEFULLY NO-ONE WILL SUFFER TOO BADLY
p239_159 IT WAS THE CLIMAX OF THE THING
p239_162 I THINK THE REFEREE WAS GOOD
p239_164 SCOTLAND WILL BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF ABBEY NATIONAL
p239_166 THEY EXIST IN NAME ALONE
p239_171 THOSE THREE WEEKS ARE TOTALLY LOST
p239_181 DID IT WORK
p239_186 THAT WAS JUST ONE NIGHT
p239_187 THIS IS A FRIGHTENING DEVELOPMENT
p239_190 SLOPPY ANSWERS ARE TO BE AVOIDED
p239_195 THE YUGOSLAV ARMY WILL STILL BE THERE
p239_196 TWO YEARS OF BUILDING A BUSINESS WILL GO UP IN SMOKE
p239_198 HE SAID THE DIRECTOR HAD BEEN COMPLETELY FRIENDLY
p239_199 TIGER IS NOT THE NORM
p239_201 MS MCNEILL WAS KILLED ON IMPACT
p239_207 WE ARE NOW WORKING WITH FULL-TIME ON FUTURE PRODUCT
p239_214 THE MUSIC IS THEREFORE PROFOUNDLY SUBVERSIVE
p239_217 THEIR PRESCRIPTION IS LARGELY ABOUT CHANGING ATTITUDES
p239_218 IT S ALL CHANGE AT KILMARNOCK
p239_221 I WAS CAUGHT OUT A LITTLE BIT
p239_222 THERE'S ALWAYS THE NEXT CENTURY
p239_224 BUT IT'S AN ENJOYABLE JOB
p239_229 KINGFISHER REPORTS INTERIM FIGURES TOMORROW
p239_230 SHE HAD GONE TO THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL
p239_248 ADAMS IS SURELY WORTH A CHANCE
p239_253 THE CHALLENGE FOR THE INDUSTRY IS TO CAPTURE AND RETAIN THAT TALENT
p239_256 HER POLITICAL PERSUASION IS NO SECRET
p239_258 ADVENTURE IS THE CHAMPAGNE OF LIFE
p239_260 I'D BEEN OUT WITH MY GIRLFRIEND AND WE WERE ATTACKED
p239_261 BOATS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT WOULD BE POOLED
p239_274 THEY ARE DETERMINED TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTION
p239_278 OUR DESTINY IS IN OUR OWN HANDS
p239_279 MILLER WAS EVERY BIT AS HAPPY
p239_297 YOU WERE AN EASY TARGET AND THEREFORE AN EASY SACRIFICE
p239_305 THEY HAVE PLAYED THEIR PART
p239_315 WHAT ARE YOU NOT GOOD AT
p239_319 THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR IS AWAY ON HOLIDAY
p239_320 I HAVE BEEN VERY NERVOUS
p239_324 IT PARTICULARLY INCREASES UNDER-AGE DRINKING HE CLAIMED
p239_328 FLANKER GORDON SIMPSON MAY ALSO FEATURE IN THAT MATCH
p239_331 IT IS A TRIUMPHANT PERFORMANCE WHICH DEFIES THE YEARS
p239_333 AND THEY HAVEN'T TAKEN THE FOOT OFF THE GAS
p239_344 THE FBI COULD BECOME INVOLVED
p239_348 IT COMES FROM REFLECTION OR THINKING
p239_351 IT WAS A MISERABLE AFTERNOON IN FIFE
p239_363 THE ACTUAL INCREASES WILL BE ANNOUNCED NEXT MONTH
p239_364 THE STATEMENT CONTAINED NO SURPRISES
p239_367 BUT THE RALLY WAS SHORT-LIVED
p239_375 THIS SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE
p239_376 IT WAS LAUNCHED IN FEBRUARY LAST YEAR
p239_387 SHE ASKED FOR THE APPOINTMENT WITH ME
p239_393 DO I HAVE A FAVOURITE
p239_405 HE ALSO LAUNCHED A NEW STRATEGY FOR THE AGENCY
p239_406 THIS GAME IS VERY EVENLY BALANCED
p239_411 YOU CAN FEEL AT HOME IN CHINA
p239_412 THIS WOULD DISCOURAGE INVESTMENT AND JOB CREATION
p239_424 THE CAPITAL COSTS ARE MODEST
p239_430 WE ACCEPT THE NEW RULES
p239_436 I ALSO HAD A LOT OF INJURIES WHICH DID NOT HELP ME
p239_438 LAST YEAR'S WINNER WAS SERGIO GARCIA
p239_440 IT IS ALSO VERY VALUABLE
p239_445 EITHER GROUP IS LIVING IN FANTASY LAND
p239_446 THAT WILL BE A DECISION FOR BBC SCOTLAND
p239_458 THEY FAILED TO REACH AGREEMENT YESTERDAY
p239_460 FURTHER SAVINGS WOULD ARISE FROM COMMON PROCUREMENT AND IT SYSTEMS
p239_462 SHE FAILED IN HER ACTION
p239_464 WE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GRIEF AND PAIN OF THEIR RELATIVES
p239_478 THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM DOESN'T DELIVER
p239_480 FIVE YEARS LATER THE DECEPTION CONTINUED
p239_486 IT HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
p239_495 THE WHOLE THING WAS JUST UNREAL
p240_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p240_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p240_025 JOHNSON WAS PRETTY LOW
p240_035 HE TOOK ME ON A TOUR OF THE WARDS
p240_045 ON THIS SHOWING THEY SHOULD STICK WITH THE LADS
p240_047 IT IS SO SAD
p240_050 WHO CAN SAY
p240_055 REBUILDING PUBLIC TRANSPORT WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
p240_058 HOWEVER THE DRAMA WAS STILL NOT AT AN END
p240_060 THAT'S THE TRUTH
p240_068 I AM PLEASED WITH THE RESULT AS IT WAS A POSSIBLE UPSET
p240_073 I WAS AS STRONG AS A HORSE
p240_081 JUST TWO MONTHS AGO IT SEEMED AN UNLIKELY THREAT
p240_085 OTHERWISE IT WILL COST A LOT OF MONEY
p240_091 TODAY I COULDN'T RUN ON IT
p240_098 IT WAS A GOOD PERFORMANCE
p240_103 THEY WILL WANT TO PERFORM WELL
p240_105 IT WAS REALLY ENJOYABLE ON SATURDAY
p240_107 IT'S IN HIS BLOOD
p240_113 THIS FILM WILL BE TOTALLY AWESOME
p240_116 EVERY WOMAN DESERVES TO LIVE WITHOUT THIS TYPE OF FEAR
p240_117 I JOINED A GROUP
p240_120 IT IS A DELIGHT ON EVERY LEVEL
p240_131 OFFERED THE GOLD MEDAL HE DECLINED
p240_134 IT IS ALSO WELL RECEIVED
p240_141 WALLACE WAS A PRISONER OF WAR
p240_148 OF COURSE WE WILL NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE SQUAD FOR EUROPE
p240_156 THE WEATHER AFFECTED THE OTHER TWO GAMES IN FIFE
p240_157 HOPEFULLY WE CAN LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES
p240_164 HOWEVER THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT HAS A MAJOR DILEMMA ON ITS HANDS
p240_166 WE HAVE A BUDGET IN MARCH
p240_168 BY THEN HOWEVER BOTH MEN WERE ALREADY IN THE US
p240_176 THEY KNOW NO OTHER WAY
p240_178 AND SHE IS A SUCCESSFUL ACTOR WITH THREE DECADES OF EXPERIENCE
p240_181 NEITHER SIDE WOULD REVEAL THE DETAILS OF THE OFFER
p240_182 THEY NEED TO LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES
p240_186 THEY REALLY DID A GREAT JOB
p240_187 IT WAS AN ODD AFFAIR IN MANY RESPECTS
p240_195 I AM TOTALLY SURPRISED
p240_202 WHO WILL PAY FOR THIS
p240_224 WOMEN WERE MOSTLY NOTABLE BY THEIR ABSENCE
p240_228 IT IS A GAMBLE
p240_233 THE BODY FOLLOWS THE MIND
p240_235 AND THOUGHT WE WOULD GET AWAY WITH IT
p240_237 IT IS NOT THE MESSAGE ALONE
p240_249 I AM THE OPPOSITE BECAUSE I HAVEN'T PLAYED VERY MUCH
p240_254 I HAVE A LOT OF RELATIVES IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY
p240_269 THIS IS A QUESTION OF ISLAM
p240_276 LOTTERY MONEY WAS INTENDED TO BE USED FOR GOOD CAUSES
p240_280 THE DECISION WAS ANNOUNCED AT ITS ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN DUNFERMLINE
p240_286 IF NOT HE SHOULD GO HOME
p240_300 SATURDAY'S MATCH WAS FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD
p240_301 A NEW SCHOOL WILL BE BUILT
p240_309 IN PERFORMANCE THAT QUALITY CAN PROVE TO BE A CHALLENGE
p240_310 WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY SURPLUS
p240_313 AND HE GOES WITH IT
p240_314 SCOTLAND HAS SHOWN THE WAY
p240_318 THEY WILL CERTAINLY BE VISIBLE FROM EVERY HOUSE IN OUR AREA
p240_319 THEY WERE FANTASTIC
p240_321 WE ARE A PEACEFUL PEOPLE
p240_332 I AM SO UPSET
p240_336 WE AGREED TO DISAGREE
p240_338 HE WAS THEN REPLACED BY ROSS
p240_343 IT IS A SIGN OF HOPE
p240_345 THREE YEARS AGO HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
p240_348 THEY MADE CLEAR THAT THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE
p240_353 HOWEVER THIS SUGGESTION WAS TURNED DOWN BY THE PLAYER
p240_354 THE COMPOSER WILL CONDUCT
p240_355 THIS IS A FRIENDLY MATCH
p240_364 THE COUNCIL SAID THE HOUSE WOULD HAVE TO BE DEMOLISHED
p240_365 THEY SAY THAT VITAL EVIDENCE WAS NOT HEARD IN COURT
p240_367 AS INDEED THEY WOULD BE
p240_369 INSTEAD HE WAS INFORMED TO JOIN THE LINE OF CREDITORS
p240_372 A DEADLINE IS STILL ESSENTIAL
p240_376 ON FUEL THE CHANCELLOR HAS A NUMBER OF OPTIONS
p240_378 IT'S BEEN HARD
p241_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p241_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p241_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p241_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
p241_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p241_029 HOWEVER THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE CANCER RETURNED
p241_031 THEY WERE DESCRIBED AS BEING IN A SERIOUS BUT STABLE CONDITION YESTERDAY
p241_033 PEOPLE LOVE TO SEE THIS STUFF
p241_034 AND WE HAVE A SINGER
p241_037 IT'S NICE TO HEAR
p241_047 AS SHE EXPLAINS
p241_048 HE IS TOO WEAK TO MOVE
p241_051 HE LOOKS LIKE AN AFGHAN
p241_052 WE'VE GOT A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE LIONS
p241_058 I WAS AN ATHLETE
p241_064 THE SCRIPT WAS FUNNY
p241_070 THE COMPANY YESTERDAY REFUSED TO COMMENT
p241_076 HE IS NOW RESIDENT IN ENGLAND
p241_077 EVEN THE ONE SHE LOVED
p241_078 I'VE GOT THE SHIRT
p241_079 THIS IS THE WAY THINGS SHOULD BE HANDLED
p241_080 JUST TWO MONTHS AGO IT SEEMED AN UNLIKELY THREAT
p241_085 SOMEONE WHO CARES
p241_101 A YEAR AGO SHE WAS JUST A JUNIOR MINISTER AT THE TREASURY
p241_108 IS THAT RIGHT
p241_110 WE WANT TO HELP THEM THROUGH IT
p241_118 THERE WILL BE A BEGINNING A MIDDLE AND AN END
p241_134 NOBODY WILL KNOW THE FEELING OF THE BRANCHES UNTIL OCTOBER
p241_139 IF PEOPLE ARE GENUINE THEN THE PROBLEM IS NOT OSAMA BIN LADEN
p241_145 I AM JUST TRYING TO DO MY JOB
p241_148 THE DUTCHMAN WAS IN TIME TO SEE THE BREAKTHROUGH
p241_166 THEY WILL DO THEIR OWN THING
p241_167 THE POST WILL BE UNPAID
p241_172 IT BECAME A BOOK BY ITSELF
p241_173 ONE SEASON THEY MIGHT DO WELL
p241_174 HOWEVER THE FIGURES WERE DISPUTED BY THE SCOTTISH PRISON SERVICE
p241_177 THE CLARITY IS VITAL
p241_180 THEY KNOW NO OTHER WAY
p241_185 EVERYONE IS IN FAVOUR OF THE NEED FOR WELFARE REFORM IN GENERAL
p241_195 IT'S THE SAME OLD STORY
p241_200 THE SISTERS ALSO BECAME THE TOP TWO PLAYERS IN THE WORLD
p241_204 THEY'VE GOT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE WAY
p241_205 I IN THE MEANTIME HAD BEEN FAR FROM CHILLING
p241_211 IT HAD ALL BEEN ARRANGED
p241_214 IT'S BEEN A GOOD YEAR
p241_215 WE WANT TO KEEP THE POUND
p241_218 THE PRIME MINISTER HAS A HUGE REGARD FOR MO
p241_222 AT THE TOP OF THE STRUCTURE WILL REMAIN THE POST OF HEADTEACHER
p241_223 WE PLAYED THEM OFF THE PITCH
p241_225 LOTTERY CASH IS RIGHTLY DEPENDENT ON GRASSROOTS APPROVAL
p241_230 IT IS NOT THE MESSAGE ALONE
p241_232 HOSPITALS ARE FOR THE ILL
p241_233 THE PERCEPTION IS THAT WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT SOCIAL ISSUES
p241_235 WE WERE EXTREMELY POOR
p241_241 MANAGER BOBBY WILLIAMSON HAS NO INJURY WORRIES
p241_244 THE PROJECT HAS ALREADY SECURED THE SUPPORT OF SIR SEAN CONNERY
p241_252 SPECIAL MEASURES WERE NEEDED
p241_259 THAT'S THE ONLY THING I WILL SAY
p241_277 WE ARE A GRANDMOTHER
p241_307 FUNDING FOR THE SCIENCE CENTRE HAS COME FROM A NUMBER OF SOURCES
p241_308 THE GOVERNMENT IN WESTMINSTER IS SIMPLY NOT PREPARED TO SAVE HIM
p241_323 THEY ALSO RECOVERED A PICTURE OF OSAMA BIN LADEN
p241_326 WE AGREED TO DISAGREE
p241_329 I'VE NOT THOUGHT ABOUT IT
p241_330 WHO WAS THE MYSTERY MP
p241_332 THEY SHOULD STOP THE BOMBING
p241_333 WHO WILL DO IT
p241_337 I MUST MAKE THAT CLEAR
p241_347 I GOT A YELLOW CARD
p241_373 TALKS ARE PROGRESSING
p241_374 THERE IS NO SIGNATURE
p243_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p243_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p243_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p243_037 THAT WAS NOT PERFECT GOLF BY ANY MEANS
p243_045 DOES IT MATTER
p243_052 WE TOOK PART IN A FESTIVAL CALLED GLOBAL DANCE
p243_053 HE SAID HE STILL PLANNED TO GO AHEAD WITH DEEP TAX CUTS
p243_054 THE IMPORTANT RETAIL BUSINESS CONTINUES TO DELIVER EXCELLENT RESULTS STEWART SAID
p243_056 THEY SEEM TOO MUCH OF A SURE THING
p243_057 HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN WAITING FOR HER RETURN
p243_062 THE REFEREE IS THERE TO DECIDE THESE THINGS
p243_072 SHE SEEMED AS MOVED BY HER OWN WORDS AS HER AUDIENCE WERE
p243_074 BUT TWO GROUPS REFUSED TO SIGN UP
p243_083 THAT KIND OF GROWTH IS THE IMPORTANT THING
p243_085 NO PLAN FOR PROJECTS ARE YET IN PLACE
p243_094 THERE IS NO ISSUE OF NATIONAL SECURITY INVOLVED HERE
p243_103 WE WERE UNDER A BIT OF PRESSURE
p243_111 FORMER HAMILTON DEFENDER COLIN MILLER COULD RETURN TO THE CLUB TODAY AS MANAGER
p243_115 SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
p243_122 ENGLAND WERE AHEAD UNTIL TWO MINUTES INTO INJURY TIME
p243_126 SO I AM GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
p243_127 NOW THE LIFE OF THIS ORCHESTRA IS VERY DIFFICULT
p243_132 HE SAID A REVIEW OF THE PLANNING PROCESS SHOULD ENCOURAGE FRESH THINKING
p243_139 THE PROGRAMME HAS BEEN MADE WITH GREAT CARE
p243_143 IT APPEARS THAT NO HOLIDAY IS COMPLETE WITHOUT A GOOD ROW
p243_151 DOES THAT PUT PRESSURE ON US
p243_153 DO YOU THINK WE ARE A TOP NATION
p243_169 WE HAD TO WORK VERY HARD FOR OUR POINTS
p243_170 THAT IS A BIG RISK AT ANY PRICE
p243_173 IF SUCCESSFUL SEVERAL RECORDS WILL BE MADE
p243_174 THE COMPANY HOPES TO TOP SEVEN MILLION PASSENGERS IN ITS CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR
p243_177 IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT WAY OF LIFE
p243_181 TRAFFIC WAS ALSO HEAVY AROUND STRATHCLYDE PARK
p243_184 WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY SINCE THEN
p243_190 THAT CAPITAL WOULD BE PROVIDED EQUALLY BY THE STATE AND ESTABLISHED COMMERCIAL COMPANIES
p243_191 YOU ARE NOT LONG HOME FROM WORK
p243_193 IT INVOLVED EVERYTHING IN TERMS OF BEHAVIOUR
p243_194 MURRAY SPENT THE EARLY PART OF HIS CAREER ELSEWHERE
p243_195 AND THEY WERE BEING PAID
p243_206 HE IS PARTICULARLY HAPPY WITH THE SIZE OF THE GALLERY
p243_209 THEY ARE A VICTIM OF THEIR OWN SUCCESS
p243_213 SCOTTISH FOOTBALL YESTERDAY APPEARED READY TO LINE UP ALONGSIDE THE SCOTLAND MANAGER
p243_227 THIS TAKES NO ACCOUNT OF HOTEL AND TOURISM LOSSES
p243_228 ROYAL BANK PROVIDED DEBT FUNDING FOR THE DEALS
p243_229 I WANT TO SEE AS MUCH PROGRESS AS POSSIBLE
p243_241 WHY CHANGE IT
p243_243 DOES THE NAME MATTER
p243_257 COMMERCIAL PRODUCERS WERE PRESENT IN LARGE NUMBERS
p243_258 DESPITE HIS SUCCESS THINGS BEGAN TO FALL APART
p243_265 HIS CONDITION WAS DESCRIBED AS SERIOUS LAST NIGHT
p243_267 THE BOARD DO NOT OWN THE COMPANY
p243_268 LAST NIGHT BUSH CARRIED IT RATHER EASILY
p243_274 MEANWHILE THE TRUST PRESENTED ITS FIRST GRANT AWARDS FOR SCOTLAND YESTERDAY
p243_278 ONE LETTER FROM A TEACHER ARRIVED AT CHRISTMAS
p243_279 YESTERDAY'S SESSION WAS THE LAST FULL ONE BEFORE CHRISTMAS
p243_296 THE STRONG PERFORMANCE IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE
p243_297 LOCAL MANAGERS ARE ALREADY INVOLVED IN TALKS WITH POTENTIAL INVESTORS
p243_304 HAD I HEARD
p243_306 ARE YOU GOING TO WIN
p243_309 IT HAPPENED ON AVERAGE ONCE A WEEK THIS YEAR
p243_310 THIS IS THE VERSION WHICH APPEARED IN OUR PAPER
p243_315 IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE BLUE AND WHITE
p243_329 I THOUGHT THE RACE WAS A LITTLE BIT SLOW
p243_336 I HOPE NUMBERS WILL BE UP ON LAST TIME
p243_344 MARTIN O NEILL CALLED THIS GAME ALMOST EXACTLY RIGHT
p243_346 IT WAS A BIT LIKE HAVING CHILDREN
p243_352 SALES WILL BEGIN BY THE END OF OCTOBER
p243_366 THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR IS AWAY ON HOLIDAY
p243_367 THE DEAD WOMAN AND THE INJURED MAN HAVE NOT YET BEEN NAMED
p243_373 THEY KNOW THE TRUTH THEY REALLY KNOW THE TRUTH
p243_375 OTHERWISE WE MIGHT AS WELL HOLD IT NOW
p243_381 THIS IS NOT A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY
p243_382 THE DOCTORS SAY THAT HE WILL BE FINE FOR THE PERFORMANCE NEXT WEEK
p243_386 WHAT KIND OF MAN DOES THAT MR DICK
p243_387 THE COST OF THIS FAILURE WILL NOT HIT THE COMMISSION
p243_389 HE REMAINS A MAIN BOARD DIRECTOR OF ROYAL
p243_390 HIS RECORD ON GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE
p243_393 BUT SOON THE GAME DROPPED BACK INTO ITS OLD WAYS
p243_397 THE REPORT WILL GO BEFORE THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT PROBABLY IN EARLY AUTUMN
p244_004 WE ALSO NEED A SMALL PLASTIC SNAKE AND A BIG TOY FROG FOR THE KIDS
p244_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION
p244_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p244_027 WE WANT TO LIFT THE CUP FOR THE FANS
p244_028 I AM NOT INTERESTED IN THE MONEY IT IS THE PRINCIPLE
p244_029 IT IS ABOUT INVESTING IN THE FUTURE
p244_032 THE END RESULT IS THE SAME
p244_035 IT SHOULDN'T COME AS A SURPRISE BUT IT DOES
p244_038 NONETHELESS THE OVERALL PICTURE IS HEALTHY
p244_042 AND THEY HAD A CASE
p244_044 IF WE CANNOT SUCCEED IN THIS ENDEAVOUR THEN SO BE IT
p244_052 THE PRESSURE ON THE PLAYERS WILL BUILD
p244_057 CLEARLY THEY HAD OTHER PROBLEMS
p244_062 THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO GROW
p244_064 WE FELT IT WAS SUFFICIENT
p244_069 IT WAS AN OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE
p244_070 I CAN'T REMEMBER A LOT ABOUT THE ACCIDENT
p244_079 WHY DO YOU WANT TO COME TO EDINBURGH
p244_081 SO IS THAT IT THEN
p244_084 WHY DO IT OTHERWISE
p244_105 I HAD NO INTENTION OF MISLEADING ANYONE
p244_112 BUT HE HAS NOT BECOME A MONSTER
p244_113 HE IS NOT A DANCER
p244_117 THIS IS A SEA CHANGE IN APPROACH
p244_121 IN THE END WE DID NOT SPEND A PENNY ON HIM
p244_122 HE WAS NOT ALONE AT THE TOP OF THE BOARD
p244_126 I AM DELIGHTED TO HAVE BEEN THE CAPTAIN OF THE WINNING SIDE
p244_129 HE WANTED TO RECORD THE GROUP
p244_131 NATURALLY IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO FIND SUPPORT FOR THESE PROPOSALS
p244_136 WHAT KIND OF MAN DOES THAT MR DICK
p244_138 SO WHAT IS THE CAMPAIGN ABOUT
p244_152 IT STARTS AT THE TOP
p244_153 OTHERS ARE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW THE LEAD
p244_156 ONE LETTER FROM A TEACHER ARRIVED AT CHRISTMAS
p244_162 THERE IS A LACK OF STAFF
p244_175 ALL THE PRESSURE WAS ON HIM
p244_185 INSIDE THE ATMOSPHERE WAS QUIET
p244_201 WE WANT TO BEGIN A PROGRAMME IN THE UK
p244_204 IT IS NOT AN ISSUE
p244_211 HE IS BELIEVED TO LIVE IN BRITAIN
p244_213 THE REPORT WAS WELCOMED BY THE LAW SOCIETY OF SCOTLAND
p244_218 IT DECIDED TO BLAME THE MEDIA
p244_221 IT WAS IMPORTANT TO WIN TODAY
p244_230 THE TICKETS WILL BE ON SALE TODAY AT THE TICKET OFFICE
p244_234 IT WILL BE DECIDED IN THE NEXT MONTH
p244_235 WE HAVE TO WIN THE GROUP
p244_239 THERE WAS A LOT OF RESENTMENT
p244_241 ALL WILL BE REVEALED IN DUE COURSE
p244_243 THE MATTER IS UNDER APPEAL
p244_255 A LOT HAS BEEN WRITTEN
p244_264 IT EXPECTED THIS TREND TO CONTINUE
p244_274 SADLY IT SOUNDS AS IF IT IS
p244_279 IT MIGHT BE SAD BUT IT'S A FACT
p244_280 IN FACT IT IS DEEPLY UNPLEASANT
p244_281 OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD WANT TO LOOK AT THIS
p244_282 ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT
p244_284 IT IS IMPORTANT THAT HE IS INVOLVED
p244_294 WE ARE IN A WAR
p244_300 SCOTLAND WON BY SIX WICKETS
p244_303 WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC
p244_304 EVERY ONE IS A WINNER
p244_318 WE HAVE TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL
p244_319 LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL OF THIS CLUB
p244_324 HOWEVER THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAIL
p244_339 LIKE MANY COMPANIES IT IS A PROBLEM
p244_347 BUT THE NEW YEAR WAS SPECIAL
p244_351 HE IS A GREAT PROSPECT
p244_353 HOWEVER WALKER REMAINS DETERMINED TO FIGHT THE PROPOSALS
p244_356 HOWEVER IT DOES NOT TELL THE FULL STORY
p244_360 IT WAS A TEST IN ITSELF
p244_361 EITHER TEAM WILL BE HARD
p244_363 AT FIRST THE YOUNGSTER WAS NOT KEEN
p244_370 THE COMMITMENT WAS NOT LONG AND IT WAS WORTH THE RISK
p244_372 THE NEWS IS NOT ALL BAD
p244_378 I WAS DELIGHTED TO ACCEPT
p244_386 AN ANNOUNCEMENT IS EXPECTED THIS WEEK
p244_391 DOES IT MATTER
p244_394 AFTER THE MATCH DO YOU
p244_400 IT IS THE LAST MEETING OF THE SEASON
p244_401 HERE TOO THE POST OFFICE HAS MISSED THE BOAT
p244_405 IT'S ALL BEEN ABOUT THE BASICS OF THE BUSINESS
p244_407 IT'S GREAT THAT IT HAPPENED IN BRITAIN
p244_414 IN ORDER TO GET THERE WE HAVE GOT TO INVEST
p244_423 HE'S HAD TO SUFFER FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS
p245_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p245_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION
p245_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p245_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p245_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p245_025 JOHNSON WAS PRETTY LOW
p245_027 IT'S NICE TO HEAR
p245_028 WE DECIDED WE WOULD GO FOR A SPECIALIST INSIDE CENTRE
p245_029 SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES ARE ALSO REPORTED TO BE INTERESTED IN THE FORMAT
p245_030 THEY SHOULD BE SO LUCKY
p245_039 IT WAS CLEAR
p245_046 MEXICO CITY WAS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE
p245_050 WHO CAN SAY
p245_053 YESTERDAY HE HAD A CHILLING WARNING FOR THE GAME IN SCOTLAND
p245_055 HE HAD NO ENEMIES
p245_056 SADLY IT CAN'T
p245_060 UNTIL RECENTLY SHE WORKED AS A RECRUITMENT CONSULTANT IN LONDON
p245_061 HOPEFULLY WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT FROM THAT GAME
p245_067 THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF RACISM IN SCOTLAND
p245_082 IT'S NEVER TOO LATE
p245_090 PREVIOUSLY THEY WERE RAISED IN THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS
p245_100 I WAS ANGRY
p245_105 WE FELT AT THE MOMENT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE
p245_108 WHO WOULD HAVE
p245_113 NEXT SEASON FOR EVERY MANAGER IS A LONG TIME AWAY
p245_127 THERE IS A LACK OF CHEMISTRY
p245_136 IT WAS DEPLOYED IN THE GULF WAR
p245_139 IT'S A PROBLEM BUT IT CANNOT BECOME AN EXCUSE
p245_142 WAS THIS ELEMENT ALWAYS THERE
p245_143 I'VE LEARNED FROM MY MISTAKES
p245_144 A LABOUR INSIDER SAID IT WAS FAR TOO CLOSE TO CALL
p245_147 THE RELEASE ATTRACTED LITTLE ATTENTION
p245_151 THEY MIGHT BE BROKEN BUT THEY ARE NOT DEFEATED
p245_154 WE WANTED IT LEFT FOR A WEE WHILE
p245_157 I DROVE THE BALL WELL
p245_165 WHAT HAS CAUSED THE DEMISE OF SINGING
p245_168 IT IS TOUGH BUT POSSIBLE
p245_181 BUT WE ARE NOT IMMUNE TO THE PROBLEM
p245_183 I HAVE A COLD
p245_188 IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY MONEY MONEY
p245_202 HE SAID THAT HEALTHY EATING WAS HIGH ON THE COUNCIL AGENDA
p245_214 AT THE TIME HE WAS A LIVING LEGEND
p245_216 YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE ABLE TO GET OUT IN SOME DIRECTION
p245_219 THE ROLE WAS A KNOCKOUT BUT REALLY DIFFICULT
p245_225 HALF OF YOUNG PEOPLE HAD HAD CONTACT WITH THE POLICE
p245_236 YOU CAN FEEL AT HOME IN CHINA
p245_247 THEY NEED TO LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES
p245_251 HE WAS MY BIG BROTHER MY FATHER MY GRANDFATHER
p245_252 FOR THE SCOTTISH JUDGES THE AFFAIR IS VERY DELICATE AND UNIQUE
p245_258 I WOULD HAVE THE HAMMER IN THE CROWD
p245_265 SIMILAR MEASURES ARE EXPECTED IN ENGLAND AND WALES
p245_274 THIS TIME FOR RANGERS IT IS CERTAINLY THE LATTER
p245_277 IT WAS A VIRUS
p245_279 IT'S VERY SAFE
p245_285 HE ADDED THAT PUBLIC TRANSPORT IMPROVEMENTS MUST ALSO BE MAINTAINED
p245_294 I THOUGHT IT WAS MY ONLY CHANCE
p245_297 THE CONFIDENCE IS LOW BUT IT IS A DIFFICULT THING TO UNDERSTAND
p245_301 ALEX SMITH HAS BEEN A MASSIVE INFLUENCE ON MY CAREER AS WELL
p245_303 YOU ARE THE GLORY
p245_309 AND THAT ANOTHER INTERESTED BODY SHOULD HAVE AN OPTION TO BUY
p245_313 CRAIG IS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR US
p245_315 THEY HAD A CONFESSION
p245_318 THERE WAS NO TIME SCALE
p245_320 LAST NIGHT HE PLEDGED TO CLEAR HIS NAME
p245_329 HOPEFULLY IT WILL COME FROM SOMEONE ON OUR SIDE
p245_332 THAT'S NOT EVICTION BECAUSE HE IS NOT A TENANT
p245_336 ACTION IS NEEDED NOW
p245_338 INDEED IT WAS MAGICAL
p245_343 IT WAS FORCED TO DIVERT
p245_346 A FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT IS EXPECTED THIS MORNING AT A NEWS CONFERENCE
p245_355 THE PRESSURE IS ON CELTIC IN THE MAIN
p246_004 WE ALSO NEED A SMALL PLASTIC SNAKE AND A BIG TOY FROG FOR THE KIDS
p246_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p246_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p246_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p246_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p246_026 WE HAVE TO PULL TOGETHER OR WE WILL HANG APART
p246_029 THEY WERE DESCRIBED AS BEING IN A SERIOUS BUT STABLE CONDITION YESTERDAY
p246_031 THIS IS THE WINDOW
p246_037 THEY'RE JUST DIFFERENT
p246_042 IT IS HARD TO AVOID THE CONCLUSION THAT LESSONS HAVE BEEN LEARNED
p246_043 IT IS GREAT TO HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL NEW SITE IN WONDERFUL COUNTRYSIDE
p246_047 IS A DRUG DEALER
p246_050 SHE LOOKED SO YOUNG
p246_054 FOR THE MEANTIME THOUGH THE SIGNS ARE GOOD
p246_055 IT IS UNIQUE
p246_060 SCOTLAND HAD GREAT ASSETS
p246_062 THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ANGER AND FRUSTRATION IN THAT MUSIC
p246_064 SOUNDS LIKE THE SIXTH SENSE
p246_084 THEY LIVED FOR THEIR CHILDREN
p246_091 IT WAS CLEAR
p246_094 I SAW THE WHOLE THING
p246_104 IT WAS AN ADVENTURE
p246_112 THEY COULD NOT IGNORE THE WILL OF PARLIAMENT HE CLAIMED
p246_121 IT'S THE TRAUMATIC EVENT IN THE CHILDHOOD OF THE NATION
p246_128 IT'S PERFECTLY FEASIBLE
p246_133 MY DAUGHTER IS AN ADULT
p246_134 HE SEES A DIFFERENCE IN THE STYLE OF THE TWO TEAMS
p246_139 SHE DIED AT HER HOME
p246_140 HE REALISES HIS MISTAKE
p246_142 I WAS AWFUL
p246_147 I AM JUST TRYING TO DO MY JOB
p246_152 THE WOMAN IS A STAR WHO HAS GROWN TO LOVE THE LIMELIGHT
p246_154 SHE HAD GONE TO THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL
p246_158 I'D LOVE TO BE LIKE PETER
p246_159 I WILL TELL YOU
p246_161 IT IS NOT LIKE US
p246_163 WE HAVE A BUDGET IN MARCH
p246_175 THE CONFERENCE IS A CHANCE FOR MEMBERS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEBATE
p246_177 THE GOALS WERE GOOD
p246_181 IT'S TO DO WITH CONTEXT
p246_186 I THINK THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN VERY VERY SLOW TO REACT
p246_191 IS THAT SUCCESS
p246_198 IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY MONEY MONEY
p246_203 HE KNOWS A LOT
p246_205 IT HAD ALL BEEN ARRANGED
p246_206 I HAVE DECIDED TO QUIT THE SHOW
p246_207 MY NEIGHBOURS ARE HORRIFIED
p246_218 IF IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T
p246_233 WELL THEY WERE THE UNLUCKY ONES
p246_240 IT IS HARD WON
p246_241 WE LOST OUR COMPOSURE TOWARDS THE INTERVAL HE SAID
p246_243 THE SCENE IS ABOUT THIS
p246_248 THERE'S THE MIX
p246_265 THERE IS NO LINK
p246_273 IT'S A WAY OF LIFE
p246_275 SHE HAS FALLEN IN LOVE WITH SCOTLAND HOWEVER
p246_278 IN ESSENCE THE TEACHING PROFESSION HAS A CHOICE
p246_279 IT IS SO VERY OBVIOUS
p246_285 BUT I'VE WON BOTH WAYS
p246_287 YOU FEEL VERY HELPLESS
p246_290 HE WILL ADDRESS THE NATION THIS EVENING
p246_295 BOMBING SLAUGHTER REJECTED
p246_297 NO BRITON HAS EVER WON
p246_314 SHE IS ON A LIFE SUPPORT MACHINE
p246_323 THERE WAS NO TIME SCALE
p246_325 IT SHOWS A GREAT DEAL TO COME BACK UNDER THAT MENTAL PRESSURE
p246_332 THIS IS THE LAST STRAW
p246_333 TWO PEOPLE WERE INTERVIEWED
p246_340 A FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT IS EXPECTED THIS MORNING AT A NEWS CONFERENCE
p246_345 HE HAD TAKEN EVERYTHING FROM ME
p246_353 HARTLEY SHOULD KNOW
p246_357 HE IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HIS FITNESS AS A FOOTBALLER
p247_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION )
p247_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END )
p247_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS )
p247_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS )
p247_032 IT IS NOT FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE)
p247_033 IT CARRIED A DOUBLE MESSAGE)
p247_035 THAT IS THE FACE OF FEAR)
p247_040 IT IS SERIOUS - BUT NOT THAT SERIOUS)
p247_047 EUROPE WILL BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE CUTS)
p247_050 THE OUTCOME OF THEIR GAME ISN'T THE IMPORTANT THING)
p247_070 IT'S NOT COVERED BY THE INSURANCE)
p247_089 WE FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE IN THIS INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT)
p247_090 PETROL PRICES WERE WIDELY BLAMED)
p247_093 ON SATURDAY IT WAS MUCH THE SAME)
p247_094 THEY LIVED FOR THEIR CHILDREN)
p247_099 THE OIL COMPANIES WOULD BE ASKED TO CONTRIBUTE)
p247_101 IT WAS CLEAR ON THURSDAY)
p247_102 BUT IT IS UP AGAIN)
p247_103 SHE HAS SO MUCH TO OFFER)
p247_110 BEFORE THE GAME WE WENT FOR A PINT)
p247_113 OUR OFFER REPRESENTS AN ATTRACTIVE PRICE FOR THE BUSINESS)
p247_117 YOU HAD BETTER BELIEVE IT)
p247_119 THIS IS A STEP BACKWARDS)
p247_121 THAT MIGHT HELP A BIT)
p247_127 I CAN'T EVEN GET INTO THE A TEAM)
p247_128 HE IS PARTICULARLY HAPPY WITH THE SIZE OF THE GALLERY)
p247_129 IN ADDITION INVESTOR CHOICE IS REDUCED)
p247_130 WE SUFFERED A LOT FOR SEVEN YEARS)
p247_131 THEY KEEP THE ATMOSPHERE IN MIND)
p247_134 BUT IT COULD BE A CONSEQUENCE OF OUR POLICY)
p247_143 I HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE)
p247_152 WHAT DO WE WANT TO DO THAT FOR )
p247_156 BEFORE IT WAS AN ORDEAL)
p247_163 HE'S NOT A CELTIC MAN)
p247_169 IT IS NOT NORMAL PRACTICE)
p247_174 THE STRONG POUND ALSO TOOK ITS TOLL)
p247_180 THEY COULD NOT MATCH IT)
p247_183 ONE SEASON THEY MIGHT DO WELL)
p247_189 THEY BOUGHT THE PROPERTY FOUR YEARS AGO)
p247_191 I PUT THE DRAWING DOWN)
p247_193 YOU KNOW THE SORT OF THING)
p247_209 IT WAS WORTH A PHOTOGRAPH)
p247_217 WHAT WAS THE MATTER FOR CONCERN )
p247_220 DID HE TRIP )
p247_221 WE USED TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY IN OUR COUNTRY)
p247_223 HIS THIRD GOAL WAS SUPERB)
p247_228 THE TRANSACTION IS NOT FEASIBLE)
p247_231 AT THE TOP OF THE STRUCTURE WILL REMAIN THE POST OF HEADTEACHER)
p247_232 WE PLAYED THEM OFF THE PITCH)
p247_236 I DIDN'T PLAY TOO WELL IN THE THIRD QUARTER)
p247_238 A SMALL NUMBER OF NEW JOBS WILL ALSO BE CREATED)
p247_250 I HAVE NEVER HEARD A RULE THAT YOU COULD BE TOO YOUNG)
p247_252 EMPLOYEES ARE ENTITLED TO FOLLOW THEIR CONTRACT TO THE LETTER)
p247_253 MR CRAWFORD IS NO STRANGER TO SCOTTISH ENTERPRISE)
p247_258 LABOUR WAS TOO BUSY TO RESPOND)
p247_260 WE HAVE NO INFORMATION ON IRAQ)
p247_262 EITHER WAY THE INVESTOR RETAINS THE PREMIUM)
p247_272 DO YOU THINK WE ARE A TOP NATION )
p247_276 SCORING IN OUR FIRST GAME WAS A BONUS FOR ME)
p247_280 SCOTLAND WON BY SIX WICKETS)
p247_287 THERE'S NOT MUCH MONEY IN CYCLING)
p247_303 MR CLINTON WAS ASKED ABOUT HIS MEMORY)
p247_309 THE RESCUE PACKAGE IS PUBLIC MONEY)
p247_317 HE WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY GENUINE)
p247_319 HIS APPEAL IS INSTANTLY UNDERSTOOD)
p247_328 WE BELIEVE THE WORLD HAS TOO MANY REFUGEES ALREADY)
p247_331 THIS IS A MOMENT TO SEIZE)
p247_334 AND HE GOES WITH IT)
p247_352 THERE WAS SOME MERIT IN THAT)
p247_357 IT WAS TOUGH TO CONTAIN THE EXCITEMENT)
p247_358 THE PAIN IS STILL ACUTE)
p247_362 IN GENERAL TERMS THE PROPOSALS ARE VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS)
p247_366 HE CAN HANDLE IT WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM)
p247_367 THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE AFTER INQUIRIES FROM A NATIONAL NEWSPAPER)
p247_374 I GOT A YELLOW CARD)
p247_380 THE POLICY HAS LED TO A BIG INCREASE IN CUSTOMER RECRUITMENT)
p247_383 IT'S AS WIDE AS A CHURCH IN HERE)
p247_394 THEATRE IS NOT A MUSEUM)
p247_403 I'M NOT GOING TO GET UPSET BY TWO COMEDY PROMOTERS)
p247_406 BUT THE FOUNDATIONS HAVE BEEN LAID)
p247_414 AFTER THE MATCH DO YOU )
p247_425 IT WAS SUBMITTED WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE)
p247_434 NO-ONE WANTED TO RUN IT TONIGHT)
p247_438 STRANGELY ENOUGH I FELT VERY SHARP)
p247_448 THERE WERE NO FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENTS)
p247_449 HE DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE)
p247_455 PEOPLE ARE SO NEGATIVE ABOUT THE WHOLE BUSINESS)
p247_457 IT RECOMMENDED THAT THEY REJECT THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION)
p247_459 THE DAMAGE IS ALL INSIDE)
p247_461 IT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE)
p247_463 THE EDINBURGH AUDIENCE WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE DIALOGUE)
p247_464 I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT MY COUNTRY)
p247_465 PHIL MICKELSON DID THAT LAST YEAR)
p247_470 THEY WERE GOOD YEARS FOR HIM)
p247_473 WE WILL NOW LOOK INTO ITS HISTORICAL BACKGROUND)
p248_029 THE MAIN CONCERN IS THAT IT COULD INTERFERE WITH AIR TRAFFIC
p248_039 IT WAS CLEAR
p248_040 PEOPLE COME INTO THE BORDERS FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE BACKGROUND
p248_042 I WAS SCARED
p248_052 IN ESSENCE THE TEACHING PROFESSION HAS A CHOICE
p248_055 HERE'S A CLUE
p248_061 WE HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING BEFORE WE MAKE ANY FINAL DECISION
p248_069 HAVE A LOOK AT OUR ACCOUNTS
p248_077 IT IS A TIME BOMB
p248_085 BY THEN HE WAS WALKING ON WATER
p248_110 IT HAD BEEN PLAYED AT FESTIVALS
p248_111 WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY SURPLUS
p248_114 IT'S NOT A NEW CONCEPT IN JAZZ
p248_115 THIS IS A SCHEME THAT HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL
p248_118 BUT THE FANS DESERVE TO KNOW
p248_128 SOME OF THE CHARACTERS WILL NOT BE PLAYED BY HUMANS
p248_129 WISH I COULD BE THERE ON SUNDAY IN PERSON BUT I CAN'T
p248_131 THE WHOLE THING OF DOING THE MOVIE WAS A RISK
p248_132 IT'S THE BIG OMISSION
p248_134 OUR INTENTIONS ARE REAL
p248_136 YESTERDAY MR HAGUE DISMISSED THE POLL
p248_140 I WAS THE LAST MAN TO TOUCH THE BALL
p248_164 I WAS IN THE TRAIN STATION OVERNIGHT
p248_165 WE KNEW WE HAD THE GOAL WE WANTED
p248_169 THE POST WILL BE UNPAID
p248_170 LAST WEEKEND IN GERMANY HE MISSED THE CUT
p248_175 BLAIR'S RESPONSE WAS WEAK
p248_179 TONY HAD ARRIVED
p248_183 FOUR POLICEMEN WERE WOUNDED
p248_185 WE DID EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK
p248_188 WHAT HAS CAUSED THE DEMISE OF SINGING
p248_199 THERE WOULD APPEAR TO BE NO MOTIVE FOR THE ATTACK
p248_201 THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR IS AWAY ON HOLIDAY
p248_202 BUT SHE MIGHT BE
p248_207 NOW IT'S ALL RIGHT
p248_209 THE AIM IS TO HAVE THE REPORTS ONLINE BY THIS AUTUMN
p248_212 THE PROPOSALS ARE TO BE DEBATED ON MONDAY BY CITY COUNCILLORS
p248_217 THE WORKERS DO NOT WANT TO READ ABOUT THEIR FUTURES IN NEWSPAPERS
p248_219 HE SAID THAT HEALTHY EATING WAS HIGH ON THE COUNCIL AGENDA
p248_222 A CAREER AS A DOCTOR IS ON HOLD
p248_228 BUT HE FAILED TO WIN THE COMMITTEE'S SUPPORT
p248_234 THEY SHOULD COME FORWARD
p248_237 IT IS NOT AN OPTION BUT A POLICY REQUIREMENT
p248_244 A THOUSAND YEARS AGO THE CHURCH WAS A POWERFUL FORCE IN EUROPE
p248_246 THE SCENE IS ABOUT THIS
p248_249 IT WAS A CRY FOR HELP
p248_252 I'VE HAD NO DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CHAIRMAN OR THE BOARD
p248_258 THEY MUST PLAY FOR EACH OTHER
p248_262 THAT IS HIGHLY UNFAIR
p248_264 THEY WANT TO SHUT THE SCOTTISH OFFICE
p248_268 I AM TOTALLY HORRIFIED BY THE SENTENCE
p248_270 HE IS A YOUNG MAN WITH A NEW DEAL
p248_271 HE WAS ALSO MARRIED WITH TWO CHILDREN
p248_272 HE'S BEEN HERE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS
p248_275 YESTERDAY HE HAD A CHILLING WARNING FOR THE GAME IN SCOTLAND
p248_279 YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE BOTH SIDES
p248_283 MALONEY IS AN ENGAGING TALENT
p248_284 IT SHOWS A CONTEMPT BY HIM FOR THE INDUSTRY
p248_285 IT IS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN THE SKILLS IN SCOTLAND
p248_289 THE MOVE WAS WELCOMED BY THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH IN SCOTLAND
p248_293 THE AWARD TO SENATOR MITCHELL WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE FOREIGN OFFICE
p248_311 OTHER PEOPLE HAD LOOKED AT IT
p248_317 HE WAS UNABLE TO COME
p248_318 I SAW SOME GOOD THINGS
p248_321 HER HUSBAND WAS VERY CONCERNED THAT IT MIGHT BE FATAL
p248_327 THE TRAIN WAS ON TIME
p248_330 INDEED IT WAS MAGICAL
p248_336 THIS IS A SECTOR IN OVERALL DEFICIT AND URGENT ACTION IS REQUIRED
p248_341 I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE PLUNGE
p248_344 THEY SAY THAT VITAL EVIDENCE WAS NOT HEARD IN COURT
p248_348 BUT NOTHING HAPPENED
p248_351 HE SEEMS TO BE PLEASED WITH THE PICTURE
p248_355 THAT WOULD HELP
p248_367 WELL THE BIG DAY HAS ARRIVED
p248_372 COLOUR WAS AT THE CORE OF HIS LIFE
p248_376 A CEASEFIRE IS A CEASEFIRE IS A CEASEFIRE
p249_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p249_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p249_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p249_016 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
p249_017 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
p249_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p249_027 IT'S NICE TO HEAR
p249_029 BECAUSE WE DO NOT NEED IT
p249_035 OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY WERE TOO UPSET TO COMMENT LAST NIGHT
p249_044 IT'S A BLESSING
p249_045 IS A DRUG DEALER
p249_047 HE IS TOO WEAK TO MOVE
p249_052 IT WILL COME ALL RIGHT
p249_055 IT HAPPENS FROM TIME TO TIME
p249_065 YOU DID NOT CHANGE OVERNIGHT
p249_066 THERE WAS A BATTLE THERE
p249_069 THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ANGER AND FRUSTRATION IN THAT MUSIC
p249_070 HAVE A LOOK AT OUR ACCOUNTS
p249_080 BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN HIT BY INJURY
p249_081 THE FIRST MINISTER IS SCHEDULED TO BE ELECTED BY THE PARLIAMENT TOMORROW
p249_087 THAT'S THE PRINCIPAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ARTIST AND A DOG
p249_097 EVERY WOMAN DESERVES TO LIVE WITHOUT THIS TYPE OF FEAR
p249_113 IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE A LENGTHY SERIES OF CLINICAL TRIALS
p249_114 ACCORDING TO THE CRITERIA HE IS QUALIFIED FOR SCOTLAND
p249_127 THERE WERE NO GROUNDS FOR HIS ACTION
p249_129 HIS SON HAS BEEN TRAVELLING WITH THE TARTAN ARMY FOR YEARS
p249_131 OUR THOUGHTS ARE WITH THE RELATIVES OF THE FAMILY
p249_138 MR HALL IS BELIEVED TO HAVE A BROKEN LEG
p249_141 IT'S A QUESTION OF FASHION
p249_142 WE NEED TO CHAT
p249_144 HE IS SEVERE
p249_146 IS THAT TITANIC
p249_157 IT IS NOT NORMAL PRACTICE
p249_160 THIS YEAR THIS MONTH WILL BE SPECIAL FOR TORRANCE
p249_162 NEITHER SIDE CAN WIN THIS WAR
p249_165 THESE DAYS ARE LONG GONE
p249_166 IT IS AN ATTITUDE OF MIND
p249_173 IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO GET ON BOARD
p249_182 THE JURY IS STILL OUT
p249_186 IT SHOULD BE EASY
p249_188 WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT CONTROLLER FATIGUE
p249_201 WE HAVE TO RECOGNISE THAT HE IS AN ELUSIVE CHARACTER
p249_202 IT IS A CASE OF TAKING A RISK
p249_205 THE MODERN APPROACH WILL ALSO BE REFLECTED IN THE TERMS OF ADDRESS
p249_209 I HAVE A COLD
p249_214 IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY MONEY MONEY
p249_217 THIS IS A GOOD MOVE FOR ME
p249_226 THE COUNCIL HAS PROPOSED A TEMPORARY BARRIER TO PROTECT THE MONUMENT
p249_258 THEY MUST PLAY FOR EACH OTHER
p249_261 THAT'S THE ONLY THING I WILL SAY
p249_263 THEY ARE NEVER HERE
p249_273 THINGS CAN CHANGE
p249_281 RUSSIAN OFFICIALS HAVE NOT DETERMINED THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT
p249_282 THIS TIME FOR RANGERS IT IS CERTAINLY THE LATTER
p249_283 YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE BOTH SIDES
p249_284 WHAT WOULD BE THE TIMETABLE FOR WITHDRAWAL
p249_295 THE MOVE WAS WELCOMED BY THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH IN SCOTLAND
p249_297 WHAT HAS ALTERED
p249_299 HE WAS ADAMANT THAT HE WAS STILL AHEAD ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS
p249_301 A POLICE INQUIRY BEGAN ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE GENERAL ELECTION
p249_309 IT WASN'T JUST THE CHARACTER AND ENERGY OF THE PLAYING
p249_310 HOWEVER HE IS A COACH AND HE REMAINS A COACH AT HEART
p249_311 A THOUSAND YEARS AGO THE CHURCH WAS A POWERFUL FORCE IN EUROPE
p249_316 IN FACT THEY HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT
p249_331 THE SAME THINGS WILL HAPPEN WITH GM FOODS
p249_338 THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE AFTER INQUIRIES FROM A NATIONAL NEWSPAPER
p249_349 THE DECISION IS AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE
p250_001 PLEASE CALL STELLA
p250_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p250_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p250_017 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
p250_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p250_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p250_026 MEETINGS WILL ALSO REMAIN PRIVATE
p250_032 NONETHELESS THE OVERALL PICTURE IS HEALTHY
p250_037 RUGBY HAS AN EXTENDED RUN
p250_040 YOU MUST ALWAYS ATTEMPT TO RAISE THE BAR
p250_054 I HAD TROUBLE WITH THE PRODUCERS
p250_056 THE CITY WELCOMED THE BRIGHTER OUTLOOK
p250_057 I EXPECT A RAPID RESPONSE
p250_058 SHE SAID SHE WAS REALLY SORRY
p250_060 THERE'S STILL PLENTY TIME LEFT
p250_069 ONLY WATER IS CURRENTLY ALLOWED
p250_072 ROBIN WILLIAMS IS VERY SUBDUED
p250_076 I WAS AS STRONG AS A HORSE
p250_080 AFTER FIVE WEEKS THE VEHICLE WILL BE SOLD AT AUCTION
p250_082 I'VE HAD IT FOR THE EXAMS
p250_091 WE ARE PROGRESSING WITH A FEW INTERESTED PARTIES
p250_098 SO DID SHE MEET HIM
p250_102 HAD I HEARD
p250_106 WE HAVE MADE NO FINAL DECISIONS
p250_110 THEY MUST BE ON COMMISSION
p250_111 HE IS AN EXTRAORDINARY WRITER ON SO MANY LEVELS
p250_115 IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A VOICE
p250_117 HOWEVER THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT AT THE SOUTHERN GENERAL HOSPITAL WAS FULL
p250_118 THE PALACE SAID THE QUEEN WAS DEEPLY SADDENED
p250_126 WHILE THEY WENT ON HOLIDAY WE GOT THE CONTRACT
p250_130 THE SITUATION IS NOT EASY BUT WE WILL PREVAIL
p250_135 WE HAVE A TEAM TO REACH THE FINAL
p250_141 THAT FIRST VICTORY MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO MY CAREER
p250_156 WAS IT THE WIFE
p250_159 FRANKLY IT WAS WORTH THE BOOKING
p250_162 IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT PAY
p250_163 IT OPENS THE DOOR TO THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE
p250_168 THE DEFENDER MADE AN IMPRESSIVE DEBUT
p250_171 THEY HAVE NOT BEEN NAMED
p250_175 HE WAS ASKED TO QUIT
p250_181 THAT WOULD OPEN THE GATES OF HELL
p250_182 FURTHER GROWTH WILL BE FUNDED FROM CASH FLOW
p250_200 WE ALWAYS FELT WE COULD WIN
p250_210 AND WE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE
p250_215 BRITISH MIDLAND HAS APPLIED FOR PERMISSION TO FLY TO THE US
p250_221 THAT MIGHT HELP A BIT
p250_232 IT WILL AFFECT THEIR WORK
p250_233 BASICALLY THEY HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE OFFER
p250_235 THE PROCESS WILL START TOMORROW
p250_236 IT'S JUST A NORMAL LIFE
p250_238 I WOULDN'T EVEN RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION
p250_240 FRIENDS OF THE EARTH SCOTLAND LAST NIGHT WELCOMED THE ANNOUNCEMENT
p250_243 A CAREER AS A DOCTOR IS ON HOLD
p250_254 PATERSON CAN AFFORD TO BE GENEROUS
p250_255 THE RIGHT DECISION HAS BEEN MADE
p250_263 HE NEEDED A KIDNEY - IT IS AS SIMPLE AS THAT
p250_264 HE IS A REPORTER FOR US
p250_271 NOW SUDDENLY WE HAVE THIS NEW LANDSCAPE
p250_272 I SHOULD THINK SO TOO
p250_280 I REJECTED THE IDEA OF A SEPARATE RESIDENCE
p250_284 AND THEY WERE BEING PAID
p250_291 THIS COULD PUT PRESSURE ON UK INFLATION
p250_293 THE MORALE OF THE YUGOSLAV ARMY IS BEGINNING TO CRACK
p250_294 I'M SO PROUD TO BE SCOTTISH TONIGHT
p250_299 BROWN IS AN INTERESTING MAN BUT HE IS NOT DESPERATE
p250_306 NO-ONE WANTED TO RUN IT TONIGHT
p250_311 STEPHEN WILL GET HIS FIRST CAP
p250_317 HE WILL ADDRESS THE NATION THIS EVENING
p250_330 JOB LOSSES WERE ALSO ANNOUNCED
p250_336 THEY WOULD NOW BE ABLE TO LOOK FORWARD WITH CONFIDENCE
p250_338 AND HE GOES WITH IT
p250_344 WE WILL LISTEN TO ANY SUGGESTION
p250_358 WE HAVE VERY LIMITED CAPACITY
p250_366 LOOK AT THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS
p250_367 THE ALLIES INTEND TO MAINTAIN THE AVERAGE
p250_369 HE HAD NO ACCESS TO THE DATABASE
p250_371 I WAS DELIGHTED TO ACCEPT
p250_375 WE ARE REALLY GOOD FRIENDS
p250_376 THE SALARY CHANGES ARE LONG OVERDUE
p250_380 THERE IS NO DEAL AS YET
p250_386 IS IT WORTH IT
p250_394 I ALWAYS KNEW SHE WAS FUNNY
p250_403 THE GOVERNMENT YESTERDAY ANNOUNCED ITS PROPOSED NEW PENSION ACCOUNT
p250_420 I'M NOT GOING TO GET UPSET BY TWO COMEDY PROMOTERS
p250_421 I WOULDN'T WANT TO MISS THAT CHANCE
p250_428 THERE IS A SOLUTION SHE BELIEVES
p250_438 NATIONAL FARMER'S UNION OF SCOTLAND PRESIDENT JIM WALKER WELCOMED THE NEW PROPOSALS
p250_445 EVERYTHING IN GOLF IS A BALANCE
p250_464 THE DAMAGE IS ALL INSIDE
p250_469 THE MOVE IS CONSIDERED A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH
p250_473 TALKS BETWEEN DIRECTORS HAVE BEEN UNDERWAY SINCE LAST MONTH
p250_474 I AM CERTAINLY THINKING ABOUT RETIREMENT
p250_477 THE CHIEF CONSTABLE HAS RETIRED
p250_478 WELL HE IS AN ARTIST
p250_479 HER BODY WAS FOUND ABOUT FOUR MILES FROM THE CAR
p250_480 THE CASTING OF HER HUSBAND WAS AN ACCIDENT
p250_495 WE WOULD WELCOME A COMMERCIAL PARTNER OR PARTNERS
p251_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p251_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p251_016 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
p251_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p251_024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
p251_025 JOHNSON WAS PRETTY LOW
p251_051 HE HAD NO ENEMIES
p251_052 I GOT A GREAT RESPONSE FROM THE PLAYERS AS I HAD EXPECTED
p251_054 I HAD RELIED ON HIM
p251_062 IT'S THAT KIND OF PLACE
p251_068 THAT WAS THE EASY ELECTION
p251_073 IT IS A TIME BOMB
p251_074 I'VE NOT THOUGHT ABOUT IT
p251_075 TODAY SHE HAS BEEN RELEASED
p251_087 YESTERDAY HE CONTINUED TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE
p251_093 THE OIL COMPANIES WOULD BE ASKED TO CONTRIBUTE
p251_094 IF YOU COULD FIND IT
p251_099 THAT WOULD BE UNLAWFUL
p251_100 NO DATE HAS BEEN SET FOR THE APPEAL
p251_104 FURTHER PROTESTS ARE LIKELY
p251_107 IT HAD BEEN PLAYED AT FESTIVALS
p251_108 I CAME TO COMPLETE
p251_112 THIS IS A SCHEME THAT HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL
p251_116 I JOINED A GROUP
p251_117 DOES THIS MEAN
p251_120 WE WORK ON THE SAME LEVEL
p251_121 WE RECOGNISE THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF GOLF IN ATTRACTING VISITORS
p251_135 MR HALL IS BELIEVED TO HAVE A BROKEN LEG
p251_138 IS THAT IT
p251_139 I HAD DECIDED TO QUIT THE SHOW
p251_141 THREE PENALTIES WERE GIVEN
p251_144 WE HAVE SEEN A COPY OF THE REPORT
p251_148 HE SETS THE NATURE OF HIS PARLIAMENT IN A SIMPLE REALISTIC CONTEXT
p251_149 YOU KNOW THE TYPE
p251_157 THERE'S A PAUSE
p251_158 NEITHER SIDE CAN WIN THIS WAR
p251_164 TELL IT LIKE IT WAS
p251_167 YOU ARE NOT GOING IN BLIND
p251_168 THE POST WILL BE UNPAID
p251_169 LAST WEEKEND IN GERMANY HE MISSED THE CUT
p251_171 I ALWAYS FELT THEY PLAYED FOR ME
p251_172 MR BLUNKETT SAID HE WAS DEEPLY CONCERNED BY THE RULING
p251_177 THE CONFERENCE IS A CHANCE FOR MEMBERS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEBATE
p251_180 WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT
p251_181 SIR JEREMY FROM GLASGOW SAID THEY HAD BEEN DELIGHTED
p251_183 WE DID EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK
p251_192 WE HAVE TO RECOGNISE THAT HE IS AN ELUSIVE CHARACTER
p251_204 I SAW SOME TERRIBLE THINGS
p251_215 HER HOME IS PERHAPS A COUPLE OF MILES FROM THE TOWN CENTRE
p251_226 THE PRIME MINISTER HAS A HUGE REGARD FOR MO
p251_228 WOMEN WERE MOSTLY NOTABLE BY THEIR ABSENCE
p251_231 WE PLAYED THEM OFF THE PITCH
p251_232 IF IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T
p251_236 IT IS A GAMBLE
p251_237 BUT HE FAILED TO WIN THE COMMITTEE'S SUPPORT
p251_253 HE ALSO LAUNCHED A NEW STRATEGY FOR THE AGENCY
p251_266 I'VE HAD NO DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CHAIRMAN OR THE BOARD
p251_275 I AM VERY ANGRY
p251_282 THAT'S THE ONLY THING I WILL SAY
p251_283 THAT DECISION IS FOR THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT AND PEOPLE
p251_298 PEOPLE HAVE NO CHOICE
p251_300 IT WAS NOT HARD TO FEEL SOME SYMPATHY FOR BAXTER YESTERDAY
p251_309 WHO DID THE RECRUITING
p251_312 THE RESULTS ARE SOMETIMES CONTENTIOUS
p251_317 WE HAVE TO SORT IT OUT OURSELVES
p251_320 OUR TASK IS TO COMPLETE THE PICTURE
p251_327 WE ARE A PEACEFUL PEOPLE
p251_329 IT WILL DECIDE TODAY WHETHER HE SHOULD BE STRUCK OFF THE REGISTER
p251_340 THE POLICE HAVE TO ACT TO HELP THEM
p251_344 FINALLY HE PAID FOR THE MOVIE
p251_352 WELL IT WON'T
p251_355 I'M VERY LUCKY
p251_357 THE COMPOSER WILL CONDUCT
p252_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p252_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p252_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p252_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p252_016 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
p252_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p252_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p252_026 THIS WOULD INCLUDE INSURANCE
p252_034 I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE
p252_039 EVERYONE HAS TO PROVE A POINT WHEN THEY CROSS THAT WHITE LINE
p252_043 THIS OPERATION WILL CHANGE HER LIFE
p252_047 THAT'S WHAT SET HIM APART
p252_057 WE WISH TO WIN BUT NOT AT ANY PRICE
p252_062 FOR A DECADE SHE WAS PROVED RIGHT
p252_068 PEOPLE COME TO SEE THE HIGHLANDS
p252_073 NONE HAS EVER BEEN FOUND
p252_079 DO I HAVE A FAVOURITE
p252_080 WHAT DO WE DO
p252_082 WHAT KIND OF A MAN DOES THAT MR DICK
p252_085 LET THERE BE LIGHT
p252_087 SCOTLAND HAS GREAT ASSETS
p252_090 THERE IS NO ISSUE OF NATIONAL SECURITY INVOLVED HERE
p252_093 EVEN IF HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY LINES
p252_096 NOW COMES THE HARD PART
p252_098 WE'RE AT HOME WHICH IS IMPORTANT
p252_101 IN HIS NEW CABINET ROLE AS PARTY CHAIRMAN IT WILL BECOME HIS PRIMARY TASK
p252_102 THEY HAD THREE CHILDREN
p252_106 AND SO IT WENT ON
p252_113 IT GETS TOO MUCH
p252_116 THEY NEED THE MONEY
p252_119 ITS FAILURE IS NO SURPRISE
p252_125 HE IS AT PEACE WITH HIMSELF
p252_127 IT SEEMED LIKE FOUR HOURS
p252_134 WE'RE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT
p252_135 LOOK GEORGE W BUSH WILL COME HERE IN TWO MONTHS
p252_139 IT SHOULD HAVE ITS OWN NETWORK
p252_142 THAT SHOWS THE IMPACT IT HAD
p252_155 I THINK THEREFORE I AM
p252_157 HE SAID SOME THINGS WHICH WERE BETTER LEFT ALONE
p252_158 HE NEARLY KILLED MY SON
p252_168 HEALTH EXPERTS SAID THEY WERE NOT SURPRISED BY THE FINDINGS
p252_174 IT WAS CLEARLY NOT A BATTLE
p252_183 I'VE NO IDEA HOW IT WORKS
p252_197 NOW HE IS BACK ON TOP AGAIN
p252_202 DO I THINK ABOUT THEM OFTEN
p252_210 IF NOT A DEAL COULD TAKE MANY MONTHS
p252_215 FINE SAID THE PRESS OFFICER
p252_216 THE QUESTIONS CAME QUICK AND FAST
p252_225 NOW THE DOOR HAS OPENED
p252_229 THREE HIT THE TARGET
p252_235 BRITAIN WILL BE LITTLE AFFECTED
p252_237 YOU KNOW THE TYPE
p252_238 THE FULL CABINET WILL MEET TODAY TO DISCUSS THE OIL CRISIS
p252_240 THAT TIME IS NOT FAR AWAY
p252_246 WALL STREET PROVIDED THE BRITISH MARKET WITH LITTLE FRESH DIRECTION
p252_251 PERHAPS IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN
p252_268 BUT THE NEXT DAY SHE PAID FOR IT
p252_269 WE STILL THINK THIS TRADE IS ON THE INCREASE
p252_276 ALL FILMS OPEN TOMORROW
p252_278 PAUL NEVER GAVE UP HOPE
p252_279 THOSE THREE GOALS IN FIVE MINUTES CHANGED THE GAME
p252_283 IT IS A DANGEROUS SPORT
p252_289 ABERDEEN HAD LITTLE TO OFFER
p252_297 HE ALSO WORKED ON GENERAL BUILDING CONTRACTS IN THE AREA
p252_301 THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR IS AWAY ON HOLIDAY
p252_309 THEIR EYES HOWEVER TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY
p252_320 THERE WAS NO CONSULTATION WITH THE EXECUTIVE AND NO NEED FOR ANY SUCH CONSULTATION
p252_325 MURRAY PLAYS DOWN RETURN
p252_331 OUR RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN VERY GOOD
p252_343 WE ARE A HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM
p252_346 SOURCES YESTERDAY SAID THE ROYAL BANK HAS DECLINED TO BACK HIM
p252_355 WHAT FORM DID THAT TAKE
p252_370 THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS TOO COMPLEX
p252_371 HE SAID LEGAL ACTION COULD BE CONSIDERED
p252_380 NEXT LEAGUE MATCHES KILMARNOCK
p252_382 HE SAID HE HAD NOW WRITTEN TO SCOTTISH INDUSTRY MINISTER LORD MACDONALD
p252_383 I GOT DROPPED FOR THAT GAME
p252_407 THE DOCTORS ARE QUITE POSITIVE ABOUT MY PROGRESS
p252_408 THEY HAD TO HAVE HOSPITAL TREATMENT
p253_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p253_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p253_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p253_010 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
p253_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p253_042 DANCING WAS HER LIFE
p253_046 IT'S THE ONLY THING
p253_051 IT IS BIZARRE
p253_057 I WAS LOST
p253_060 SEVERAL OTHER PUPILS AND STAFF WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED IN THE ACCIDENT
p253_067 AND IF HE HADN'T BECOME A MUSICIAN
p253_073 THEY DID NOT REPLACE IT WITH A CONVICTION FOR CULPABLE HOMICIDE
p253_075 WE HAVE TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF TRUST WHICH IS NOT EASY
p253_078 THE PARTY IS UP FOR IT
p253_080 MR IRVINE SAID MR RAFFERTY WAS NOW IN GOOD SPIRITS
p253_082 I WILL MISS HIM
p253_103 TWO OF THE TEAM BECAME ILL
p253_107 IT WAS AN ADVENTURE
p253_111 I WAS FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE I THOUGHT
p253_115 IT WAS THE EIGHTIES
p253_122 WE ENJOYED IT TODAY
p253_131 I AM NOW UNEMPLOYED
p253_142 HE REALISES HIS MISTAKE
p253_149 IT WILL INCLUDE THE BLACK WATCH THE ROYAL HIGHLAND REGIMENT
p253_161 WELL HE SHOULD KNOW
p253_168 I WAS IN THE TRAIN STATION OVERNIGHT
p253_169 WE HAVE A BUDGET IN MARCH
p253_173 IN A WAY HE WAS
p253_185 EVERYONE IS IN FAVOUR OF THE NEED FOR WELFARE REFORM IN GENERAL
p253_190 IT CAUSED A LOT OF UPSET
p253_191 BUT A FINAL DECISION WILL NOT BE TAKEN UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTIONS
p253_194 PEACE WAS WON
p253_200 WHO WILL PAY FOR THIS
p253_203 IT WAS WORTH A PHOTOGRAPH
p253_205 WE HAVE AN ELECTION IN EIGHT DAYS
p253_206 FEEL THE HEAT
p253_220 CLEARLY THE STAKES ARE HIGH
p253_227 JIM WALLACE THE JUSTICE MINISTER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT PRISONER NUMBERS WERE A CONCERN
p253_228 MY WIFE AND FAMILY ARE THE SUPPORT SYSTEM
p253_229 HER CONDITION WAS YESTERDAY DESCRIBED AS CRITICAL BUT STABLE
p253_230 DEWAR IS CERTAINLY UNDER ATTACK FROM WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY
p253_241 THE SCENE IS ABOUT THIS
p253_256 HOWEVER THE FORCE HAS NOT YET RECEIVED A FORMAL COMPLAINT
p253_268 JIM WALLACE JUSTICE MINISTER HAS REFUSED TO HOLD AN INQUIRY
p253_269 THE DECISION WAS ANNOUNCED AT ITS ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN DUNFERMLINE
p253_272 HE PROMISED TO LEAD FROM THE FRONT IN THE BATTLE FOR ENTRY
p253_273 SHE LOOKED SO YOUNG
p253_275 IT'S SO AWFUL
p253_276 SURELY THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT IS ENTITLED TO TAKE A VIEW ON THAT
p253_277 THERE WAS A FINAL REVEALING DETAIL ABOUT THE BROADCAST
p253_291 NOTHING IS SAFE
p253_294 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO GET A PROGRAMME FOR GOVERNMENT
p253_299 IT COULD WORK
p253_302 THERE'S NO EVIDENCE HE WAS EVER THERE
p253_317 OUR MESSAGE WAS INCLUSIVE
p253_324 HOWEVER THEY WILL ONLY BE FOUND IN THE WILD
p253_327 THAT'S NOT EVICTION BECAUSE HE IS NOT A TENANT
p253_328 LOCALLY TOO THE MP IS UNDER FIRE
p253_330 I'VE GOT NO SECRET
p253_332 THIS IS A FRIENDLY MATCH
p253_343 YET HE LEFT A FEW DAYS LATER
p253_344 IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOMEONE WAS KILLED
p253_345 AS INDEED THEY WOULD BE
p253_350 THAT WOULD HELP
p253_354 HE IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HIS FITNESS AS A FOOTBALLER
p253_367 THERE WASN'T A GOAL
p253_372 THE CABINET IS SPLIT OVER THE ISSUE
p253_374 OF COURSE WE WILL NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE SQUAD FOR EUROPE
p253_378 DOES THAT PUT PRESSURE ON US
p253_385 WELL IT DID LAST TIME HE WAS REMINDED
p253_387 THEY ARE GOOD
p253_388 I'M GLAD I CAME
p253_391 IT WILL TAKE PLACE IN JULY
p253_400 THE WEEKLY AVERAGE WAS THREE HOURS
p253_408 IT IS LEGALLY BINDING
p254_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p254_017 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
p254_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p254_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p254_030 THE APPEAL TRIBUNAL WILL GIVE ITS DECISION AT A LATER DATE
p254_034 WE MUST PROVIDE A LONG-TERM SOLUTION TO TACKLE THIS ATTITUDE
p254_035 THEN SUDDENLY THEY WEREN'T
p254_038 HOWEVER THEY CONTINUED IN THEIR PURSUIT OF VICTORY
p254_051 WE'RE IN THE PREMIER DIVISION AND WE INTEND TO STAY THERE
p254_055 BUT IT MIGHT HAVE DONE
p254_058 HE IS TOO WEAK TO MOVE
p254_068 IT IS NOT A PROCESS WHICH CAN BE COMPLETED OVERNIGHT
p254_070 THE STORY WAS FIRST REPORTED IN THE SPECTATOR MAGAZINE
p254_074 THERE WAS A BATTLE THERE
p254_075 IT'S GOOD NEWS AND LONG OVERDUE
p254_078 THEY NEVER GAVE UP HOPE
p254_081 IT'S ALL I CAN DO
p254_084 THE PRICE CUTS ARE REALLY EXCITING
p254_087 THERE WAS AN E-MAIL
p254_092 HOWEVER WE WILL OBVIOUSLY KEEP THE MATTER UNDER REVIEW
p254_094 LAST WEEK HE WAS TAKEN INTO HOSPITAL
p254_103 THE GROUP IS DUE TO REPORT BY THE END OF THE YEAR
p254_110 HE TAKES THE JOB
p254_115 IT IS NORMAL
p254_121 THE FIRE WAS ABOVE THE HOLE
p254_122 THIS IS A SCHEME THAT HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL
p254_123 WE ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE ON THIS MISSION AND WE WILL PREVAIL
p254_124 MR CHISHOLM SAID THE MOVE WAS MADE ON THE ADVICE OF CONSULTANTS
p254_128 STRATHCLYDE POLICE ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT NEXT MONTH
p254_129 IT IS A JOB CREATION SCHEME
p254_145 WE WILL CONTINUE TO TALK TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR SCOTTISH FOOTBALL
p254_158 WE WILL TURN THE CORNER
p254_160 INSIDE THE ATMOSPHERE WAS QUIET
p254_163 IT HAS TO BE NOW
p254_166 TELL IT LIKE IT WAS
p254_168 YET IT IS UNLIKELY TO BE EITHER FULL OR FINAL
p254_170 LAST WEEKEND IN GERMANY HE MISSED THE CUT
p254_179 TONY HAD ARRIVED
p254_181 I WAS TOTALLY WRONG
p254_187 PEACE WAS WON
p254_190 OFF I WENT
p254_192 IS THAT IT
p254_198 THE ALBUM WAS WIDELY EXPECTED TO BE A COMMERCIAL DISASTER
p254_200 WE WILL GIVE A FORMAL RESPONSE TO THE REPORT IN DUE COURSE
p254_219 WE PLAYED THEM OFF THE PITCH
p254_245 THE PROJECT HAS ALREADY SECURED THE SUPPORT OF SIR SEAN CONNERY
p254_246 HE GOT THE SAME STORY
p254_250 THERE'S THE MIX
p254_251 THERE WILL BE WIDESPREAD SUPPORT ON ALL SIDES
p254_255 IT'S A SOURCE OF DEEP CONCERN
p254_265 THERE IS NO LINK
p254_268 HE CLAIMED HIS INSURANCE COMPANY CONTESTED THE DAMAGES NOT THE RESTAURANT
p254_270 IT WAS AN EASY DECISION TO COME HERE
p254_272 IT DEPENDS ON THE INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE
p254_281 IF NOT HE SHOULD GO HOME
p254_282 FOR THE MOMENT THAT IS THE RESULT OF THE X-RAY
p254_289 THE MOOD IS GOOD
p254_295 THAT COULD CHANGE
p254_301 THE COURT WAS SHOWN A VIDEO OF THE HOUSE ON THAT DAY
p254_302 I DID NOT NAME IT
p254_304 CHRIS SMITH THE CULTURE SECRETARY SAID HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE DECISION
p254_305 THEY WERE FANTASTIC
p254_315 IT IS A STRONG CASE
p254_320 IT WAS NO SECRET THAT I WANTED TO SIGN HIM
p254_330 THEY HAVEN'T GOT A HOPE
p254_333 TODAY SHE HAS BEEN RELEASED
p254_336 IT IS LINKED TO THE ROW OVER PROPOSED CHANGES AT SCOTTISH BALLET
p254_337 IT SHOULD BE SCRAPPED
p254_343 IT IS LONG GONE
p254_347 THAT IS A BREAK WITH TRADITION
p254_352 BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE CLOSURE OF THE EXPORT MARKET
p254_356 NEW ZEALAND RUGBY IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
p254_361 SADDAM IS NOT THE ONLY EXAMPLE OF EVIL IN OUR WORLD
p254_369 FIVE MEMBERS WERE DISCIPLINED
p254_372 YESTERDAY THE COMPANY REPORTED A FURTHER DOWNTURN IN PROFITS
p254_376 WE FELT AT THE MOMENT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE
p254_379 OF COURSE WE WILL NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE SQUAD FOR EUROPE
p254_381 FACE TO FACE
p254_397 I CAN LEAD BY EXAMPLE
p254_403 IT WAS ON FIRE
p255_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION
p255_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p255_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p255_010 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
p255_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p255_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p255_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p255_028 WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS IS ENTIRELY TRANSPARENT
p255_035 TWO OTHER MEN INCLUDING THE TAXI DRIVER WERE WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK
p255_041 BUT IT MIGHT HAVE DONE
p255_045 SHE LOOKED SO YOUNG
p255_046 LIFE IS GOOD
p255_053 BECAUSE WE DO NOT NEED IT
p255_061 OVER TIME WITH PATIENCE AND PRECISION THE TERRORISTS WILL BE PURSUED
p255_064 WE WELCOME THE DECISION OF MR BYERS
p255_066 IT CAME AS A SURPRISE BECAUSE MY JOB IS TO GO BACKWARDS
p255_071 FERGUSON SHOULD TAKE NOTE
p255_075 TWO ISRAELI CABINET MINISTERS WERE IN THE BUILDING AT THE TIME
p255_087 IT IS A LIFELINE
p255_090 THAT DEAL WILL BE DECIDED UNDER THE EXISTING RULES
p255_092 WE COULD NOT GET ANY POSSESSION
p255_097 MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AT FAULT
p255_099 TWO OF THE TEAM BECAME ILL
p255_102 SCOTLAND WERE BEATEN AGAIN
p255_104 FURTHER PROTESTS ARE LIKELY
p255_121 I CAN'T EVEN GET INTO THE A TEAM
p255_122 WEDNESDAY NIGHT WAS A DIFFICULT TIME FOR BRITTON
p255_124 HIS SON HAS BEEN TRAVELLING WITH THE TARTAN ARMY FOR YEARS
p255_129 IF NOT A DEAL COULD TAKE MANY MONTHS
p255_149 IT IS LIKE A FOOTBALL TEAM
p255_151 HE SETS THE NATURE OF HIS PARLIAMENT IN SIMPLE REALISTIC CONTEXT
p255_152 IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT PAY
p255_155 THE WEAKNESSES ARE FEW
p255_163 THE WEATHER AFFECTED THE OTHER TWO GAMES IN FIFE
p255_168 WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD
p255_172 HE IS KEEN TO STAY IN PUBLIC SERVICE
p255_179 HIS TEAM MANAGEMENT WAS PROTECTIVE
p255_183 HOWEVER THE FIGURES WERE DISPUTED BY THE SCOTTISH PRISON SERVICE
p255_184 AND I SAW THE LIGHT
p255_189 I HAVE THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF NEXT SEASON TO PROVE MYSELF
p255_190 THE GOALS WERE GOOD
p255_191 THERE IS NO POINT IN LOOKING ANY FURTHER
p255_196 THEY ARE NOW DIVORCED
p255_200 IT IS A FARCE
p255_202 WE MUST KEEP OUR FEET ON THE GROUND
p255_211 WE WILL GIVE A FORMAL RESPONSE TO THE REPORT IN DUE COURSE
p255_212 WE'RE NOT SEEING AN IMAGE OF THE PERSON HE SAID
p255_218 I HAD DECIDED TO QUIT THE SHOW
p255_227 ON A TECHNICAL LEVEL THEY WERE NOT AFRAID TO PLAY GOOD FOOTBALL
p255_242 DEWAR IS CERTAINLY UNDER ATTACK FROM WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY
p255_254 CHAMBERS SAID HE WOULD ACCEPT THE PLACE
p255_257 WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE CULTURE OF LONG HOURS
p255_258 I CAN'T GET A JOB
p255_261 THAT WAS A BONUS BUT IT WAS NOT THE MAIN OBJECTIVE
p255_264 I AM VERY ANGRY
p255_265 THEY MUST PLAY FOR EACH OTHER
p255_269 THE WORK BETWEEN THE MUSICIANS AND THE FIRE IS VERY IMPORTANT
p255_282 IN ESSENCE THE TEACHING PROFESSION HAS A CHOICE
p255_285 THIS IS A NATIONAL CRISIS
p255_286 THE DEATH TOLL INCLUDED FIVE CHILDREN
p255_287 MY BODY IS CLEARLY CAPABLE
p255_297 A NEW SCHOOL WILL BE BUILT
p255_308 IT'S CERTAINLY DIFFERENT
p255_318 I ASKED FOR A POSITIVE RESPONSE AND I WAS GIVEN ONE
p255_319 FOR THE MOMENT OUR POSITION REMAINS THE SAME
p255_320 REFEREES ARE EASY TARGETS
p255_323 THAT'S THE LAW OF THE LAND
p255_330 IT COULD HAVE GONE EITHER WAY
p255_335 THEY HAVEN'T GOT A HOPE
p255_337 THAT'S NOT EVICTION BECAUSE HE IS NOT A TENANT
p255_343 THAT IS THE VERY REASON WHY IT WAS SO VITAL
p255_344 IN THE EARLY DAYS I WAS OBSESSED WITH WORKING IN THE THEATRE
p255_361 OBVIOUSLY WE WERE PRETTY CLOSE IN A COUPLE OF GAMES
p255_364 NOT SO IT SEEMS
p255_372 YESTERDAY THE COMPANY REPORTED A FURTHER DOWNTURN IN PROFITS
p255_374 NOT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SING ABOUT SOMETHING
p256_004 WE ALSO NEED A SMALL PLASTIC SNAKE AND A BIG TOY FROG FOR THE KIDS
p256_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p256_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p256_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p256_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p256_029 THERE'S A STORY TOO
p256_041 IT HAD BEEN PLAYED AT FESTIVALS
p256_043 SHE IS BELIEVED TO BE IN SOUTH AFRICA
p256_045 NO MEANINGFUL RESPONSE WAS ISSUED
p256_052 IT HAS BEEN A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE TIME
p256_054 NO-ONE HAS APPEARED IN COURT IN RELATION TO HER DEATH
p256_055 HE HAD NO ENEMIES
p256_061 THAT IS VERY HARD ALONE
p256_066 THE RATE OF GROWTH IN ROAD TRAFFIC IS ALREADY BEGINNING TO SLOW
p256_067 GEORGE ROBERTSON DESCRIBED THE PLAN AS AN OUTRAGEOUS AND DISGRACEFUL DECISION
p256_068 THEY MAY YET HAVE THE LAST LAUGH
p256_078 IT SHOULDN'T COME AS A SURPRISE BUT IT DOES
p256_082 THIS IS THE WAY THINGS SHOULD BE HANDLED
p256_093 THAT WILL COME AFTER THE GAME ON SATURDAY
p256_095 WE MUST LOOK FORWARD
p256_098 SHE TOLD THE HERALD
p256_105 A YEAR AGO SHE WAS JUST A JUNIOR MINISTER AT THE TREASURY
p256_118 IT WOULD NOT DO ANY HARM TO REINFORCE THE MESSAGE
p256_128 CHILD ABUSE IS A DREADFUL THING
p256_132 WELL YOU CAN HAVE A TREE
p256_137 IT IS ALSO WELL RECEIVED
p256_149 CRUCIALLY THOUGH UNITED WERE STILL ALIVE
p256_151 THERE'S A SENSE OF EXCESS IN THE NOVEL
p256_153 IT WAS BY THE NUMBERS
p256_155 WE WILL TURN THE CORNER
p256_158 ALEX HAS BEEN A HUGE INFLUENCE ON THE CLUB
p256_165 WE KNEW WE HAD THE GOAL WE WANTED
p256_166 IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR A FATHER ANYWAY AND I WAS FOREVER GRATEFUL
p256_178 THEY TOOK A RISK
p256_180 THERE IS NO POINT IN LOOKING ANY FURTHER
p256_181 NOTHING IS SAFE
p256_183 FOUR POLICEMEN WERE WOUNDED
p256_200 I HAVE A COLD
p256_202 TOMMY IS NOT A PROBLEM
p256_203 THE GUIDELINES ARE EXPECTED TO BE FINALISED BEFORE NEXT SPRING
p256_204 THEY'VE GOT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE WAY
p256_209 BUT I AM A WORRIED MAN
p256_212 IT HAD ALL BEEN ARRANGED
p256_216 THE WORKERS DO NOT WANT TO READ ABOUT THEIR FUTURES IN NEWSPAPERS
p256_219 WE'VE GOT THE BRONZE
p256_227 MY NEIGHBOURS ARE HORRIFIED
p256_238 THE HOME OFFICE WOULD NOT RELEASE ANY FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE GROUP
p256_239 HE WAS GOOD BUT NOT THAT GOOD
p256_249 I'VE BEEN IN TWO FINALS AND I'VE GOT A MEDAL
p256_250 IT WAS A HIT
p256_256 THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE HAD TO GET A WIN
p256_259 ONE MP SAID HE FEARED THE JOB LOSSES WERE ONLY THE BEGINNING
p256_260 IT IS A MARK OF RESPECT FROM THE INMATES
p256_262 I AM VERY ANGRY
p256_266 THEIR FINDINGS ARE PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL INJURY PREVENTION
p256_267 THAT'S THE ONLY THING I WILL SAY
p256_278 IN FACT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE SURVIVAL BUSINESS
p256_284 THE GOVERNMENT IS KEEN TO PROMOTE THE GROWTH OF FRIENDLY SOCIETIES
p256_296 IT BECAME A BOOK BY ITSELF
p256_297 THE HOME WAS NOW UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT
p256_307 IT IS NO SURPRISE
p256_308 LET'S HOPE IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE
p256_309 O NEILL IS CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE
p256_314 IT IS ALL CREDIT TO THEM TODAY
p257_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p257_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p257_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p257_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p257_016 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
p257_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p257_025 WE HAVE TO PULL TOGETHER OR WE WILL HANG APART
p257_028 BECAUSE WE DO NOT NEED IT
p257_031 IT WAS CLEAR
p257_048 AS SHE EXPLAINS
p257_050 HE HAD NO ENEMIES
p257_052 BUT THE LAW IS VERY CLEAR ON THIS
p257_054 WE WERE SURPRISED TO SEE THE PHOTOGRAPH
p257_056 IT'S VERY ODD
p257_057 THE STORY WAS FIRST REPORTED IN THE SPECTATOR MAGAZINE
p257_061 SCOTLAND HAD GREAT ASSETS
p257_062 THERE WILL BE TOUGH OPPONENTS TO THIS REPORT
p257_070 THE PRICE CUTS ARE REALLY EXCITING
p257_075 IS THERE A NEW WAY FORWARD
p257_079 IT IS NOT LONG TERM BUT I NEED TIME TO RECOVER
p257_081 IT MAY WELL HAVE BEEN
p257_083 HE SEEMS TO BE PLEASED WITH THE PICTURE
p257_085 I IN THE MEANTIME HAD BEEN FAR FROM CHILLING
p257_100 IT WAS MAYHEM
p257_103 WE HAVE EVERY RESPECT FOR MICHELLE
p257_104 THAT TIME IS NOT NOW HOWEVER
p257_105 I DIDN'T PLAY WELL LAST YEAR
p257_112 I DON'T HAVE MANY FRIENDS
p257_115 WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY SURPLUS
p257_117 IT'S NOT A NEW CONCEPT IN JAZZ
p257_132 THE TRIAL IS FUNDED SOLELY BY EDINBURGH CITY COUNCIL
p257_133 THE WHOLE THING OF DOING THE MOVIE WAS A RISK
p257_134 I AM NOW UNEMPLOYED
p257_137 OUR INTENTIONS ARE REAL
p257_149 THAT GROUP REPORTED JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS
p257_152 THEY DID VERY WELL
p257_153 IT BECAME A BOOK BY ITSELF
p257_158 THERE'S A PAUSE
p257_160 IT WAS SO NEW SO EXCITING
p257_168 AS FAR AS WE WERE CONCERNED THE DEAL WITH KENNEDY WAS DEAD
p257_191 THE SPOKESWOMAN SAID THE FLAT IN LONDON WAS VERY SMALL
p257_193 THERE WOULD APPEAR TO BE NO MOTIVE FOR THE ATTACK
p257_199 IT S ALL IN THE HAIR
p257_202 THIS GIVES A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO SWITCH
p257_207 WE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE THE COURSES AND AN ABUNDANCE OF CONFIDENCE
p257_210 A GRAMPIAN POLICE SPOKESMAN SAID
p257_211 WE HAVE GOT TO GET IT RIGHT
p257_219 AT THE TOP OF THE STRUCTURE WILL REMAIN THE POST OF HEADTEACHER
p257_230 THE SINGER IS EXPECTED TO BE IN HOSPITAL FOR SEVERAL DAYS
p257_231 ON THE GROUND THE WEST BANK WAS AGAIN THE FOCUS OF VIOLENCE
p257_235 MY FUTURE IS IN THE MARATHON
p257_240 IT IS A POLICY WHICH HAS THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE MINISTER
p257_241 I SHOULD THINK SO TOO
p257_250 THEY ARE INTERIOR DESIGNERS AND ARCHITECTS
p257_283 RIGHT UP UNTIL A WEEK AGO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE VERY KEEN
p257_287 GRAEME WAS PREPARED
p257_296 IT WASN'T JUST THE CHARACTER AND ENERGY OF THE PLAYING
p257_301 I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD TAKE THIS LONG
p257_302 IN FACT THEY HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT
p257_307 MS ANDERSON YESTERDAY PUT A BRAVE FACE ON THE DEPARTURE
p257_312 WE ARE IN THE END GAME
p257_319 YOU CAN SEE IT ON THE TRAINING GROUND AND AROUND THE HOTEL
p257_324 THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE AFTER INQUIRIES FROM A NATIONAL NEWSPAPER
p257_326 I'VE GOT NO SECRET
p257_327 LOOK AT THE WITNESSES
p257_329 WE MUST DO SOMETHING
p257_330 HE SAYS THAT HE IS NO DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER MAN
p257_334 IT IS NOT LIKE WORKING FOR A LIVING
p257_335 IT IS LONG GONE
p257_343 WE ARE DELIGHTED AT THE RESPONSE FROM POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS
p257_345 INSTEAD HE WAS INFORMED TO JOIN THE LINE OF CREDITORS
p257_347 HIS LEGAL ADVISER WAS ALSO NOT IN COURT YESTERDAY
p257_348 HE COULD FACE A JAIL SENTENCE
p257_354 IT'S A LONG PROCESS
p257_358 WHETHER HIS STANCE IS SHARED BY THE INCOMING MANAGER IS ANOTHER MATTER
p257_359 IT DOES NOT EVEN HAVE A STAFF SHORTAGE
p257_376 I CAN LEAD BY EXAMPLE
p257_384 I NEVER WON A PENNY THROUGHOUT MY CAREER
p257_385 EMOTIONS WERE COMPLEX
p257_388 YOU ASK THE QUESTION
p257_398 I WAS VERY YOUNG
p257_403 IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK THAT WAY
p257_408 SHE HAS REACHED THE TOP OF HER PROFESSION
p257_416 RATHER THAN ANSWER SHE RESIGNED
p257_417 WAR IS NOT THE ACTION
p257_424 CHARLIE GORDON LEADER OF THE COUNCIL DISMISSED THE SUGGESTION
p257_430 THE FIRST MINISTER IS OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED TO HEAR ABOUT THIS INCIDENT
p258_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p258_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p258_010 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
p258_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p258_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p258_030 HOWEVER THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE CANCER RETURNED
p258_032 HE TOOK ME ON A TOUR OF THE WARDS
p258_033 THEY DID NOT REPLACE IT WITH A CONVICTION FOR CULPABLE HOMICIDE
p258_036 IT IS NOT FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE
p258_038 I WAS SCARED
p258_040 IT IS GREAT TO HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL NEW SITE IN WONDERFUL COUNTRYSIDE
p258_041 THE JUDGE SAID
p258_042 WE NEED TO CHAT
p258_047 IT IS THE WHOLE PACKAGE
p258_049 WE WERE SURPRISED TO SEE THE PHOTOGRAPH
p258_051 WE HAVE NOT GIVEN UP HOPE
p258_058 IT SHOULD BE DEVOLVED
p258_064 THAT WAS THE EASY ELECTION
p258_065 IT'S ALL I CAN DO
p258_066 THE PRICE CUTS ARE REALLY EXCITING
p258_068 THE GIRLS ARE SO LUCKY TO BE ALIVE
p258_075 HOWEVER WE WILL OBVIOUSLY KEEP THE MATTER UNDER REVIEW
p258_078 NOTHING IS YET CONFIRMED
p258_079 NEW ZEALAND RUGBY IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
p258_084 THEY ARE DIFFERENT TYPES
p258_087 TWO OTHER MEN INCLUDING THE TAXI DRIVER WERE WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK
p258_088 THERE WAS NO RESCUE
p258_102 SHE HAS BEEN SHOT
p258_106 HE SAID HE WAS IMPRESSED BY THE SET-UP AT CELTIC
p258_112 UNTIL THE WEEKEND HE WAS MINISTER FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE
p258_114 THIS IS THE END OF A CHAPTER AND IT IS VERY SAD
p258_116 IT IS A DELIGHT ON EVERY LEVEL
p258_120 THERE WILL BE NO SHORTAGE OF QUALITY APPLICANTS
p258_123 SHE DOES NOT WANT TO SPEAK
p258_126 OUR THOUGHTS ARE WITH THE RELATIVES OF THE FAMILY
p258_134 MY CONSCIENCE IS NOT CLEAR
p258_141 LABOUR'S SCOTTISH GENERAL SECRETARY ALEX ROWLEY WAS DELIGHTED YESTERDAY
p258_145 THE FBI COULD BECOME INVOLVED
p258_156 THEY SAY THAT VITAL EVIDENCE WAS NOT HEARD IN COURT
p258_159 LOCAL MANAGERS ARE ALREADY INVOLVED IN TALKS WITH POTENTIAL INVESTORS
p258_162 I LOST MY HEAD
p258_167 I ALWAYS FELT THEY PLAYED FOR ME
p258_181 WE DID EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK
p258_185 IT IS A TERRIBLE LOSS
p258_197 FERGUSON SHOULD TAKE NOTE
p258_201 WE SEE THE RAPID REACTION FORCE AS THE WAY AHEAD
p258_205 WE HAVE AN ELECTION IN EIGHT DAYS
p258_215 WE WANT TO KEEP THE POUND
p258_217 HE SEEMED TO LOSE HIS FOCUS
p258_219 HIS DEATH WAS A TRAGIC ACCIDENT
p258_233 THEY HAD NO CHILDREN
p258_234 WE ARE IN THE HAT
p258_242 IT IS HARD WON
p258_243 IT IS LINKED TO THE ROW OVER PROPOSED CHANGES AT SCOTTISH BALLET
p258_246 IT IS A POLICY WHICH HAS THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE MINISTER
p258_258 CHELSEA WAS A GREAT CLUB
p258_259 IT WILL NOW RELATE TO ALL PUBLIC BODIES IN SCOTLAND
p258_260 I WAS IN JAIL FOR FIVE YEARS
p258_271 BROWN IS AN INTERESTING MAN BUT HE IS NOT DESPERATE
p258_278 IT'S A WAY OF LIFE
p258_279 THE RECORD COMPANIES HAVE GONE THROUGH THE FLOOR
p258_284 I INTENDED TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER CLUB ON LOAN
p258_286 THIS IS A NATIONAL CRISIS
p258_289 IT SHOWS A CONTEMPT BY HIM FOR THE INDUSTRY
p258_303 A POLICE INQUIRY BEGAN ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE GENERAL ELECTION
p258_325 HOWEVER THE GROUPS DENIED THE CLAIMS
p258_326 THERE WAS SOME MERIT IN THAT
p258_328 IT IS A STRONG CASE
p258_333 ROBERT IS A SPECIAL TALENT
p258_336 THEY HAVEN'T GOT A HOPE
p258_337 HE DID A GOOD JOB
p258_341 INDEED IT WAS MAGICAL
p258_347 THE COMPOSER WILL CONDUCT
p258_357 IT WAS VERY FORMAL
p258_360 NO OTHER JOB IN WORLD FOOTBALL CAN COMPARE TO THIS ONE
p258_370 I AM A STAR
p258_373 HE COULD FACE A JAIL SENTENCE
p258_381 MS MCNEILL WAS KILLED ON IMPACT
p258_386 THAT TEAM IS DUE TO BE ANNOUNCED THIS MORNING
p258_395 PUBLIC CONFIDENCE WAS UNDERMINED BY THAT TERRIBLE TRAGEDY
p258_402 IT IS FULL-SCALE
p258_405 THEY ARE NOT LEFT WING
p258_414 ALSO IT IS THE SEASON OF GOODWILL
p259_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB )
p259_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW )
p259_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS )
p259_010 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT )
p259_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION )

p260_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p260_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p260_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p260_029 THEY HAVE NO HISTORY
p260_032 THERE'S A STORY TOO
p260_033 THIS IS THE WINDOW

p260_179 I SAW MILITARY VEHICLES IN THE DISTANCE

p260_229 THERE IS NO EXCUSE
p260_233 THE CAR WAS JUST THERE
p260_239 THE PROJECT HAS ALREADY SECURED THE SUPPORT OF SIR SEAN CONNERY
p260_241 IN THE MEANTIME THE FANS WOULD SETTLE FOR A DERBY WIN
p260_242 NOW SUDDENLY WE HAVE THIS NEW LANDSCAPE
p260_245 THERE'S THE MIX
p260_248 HE WAS MY BIG BROTHER MY FATHER MY GRANDFATHER
p260_250 HOWEVER IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT OFFERS OF FURTHER PAYMENTS ARE UNLIKELY
p260_252 IT WILL NOW RELATE TO ALL PUBLIC BODIES IN SCOTLAND
p260_259 THIS COURT HAS MADE AN ORDER WHICH HAS NOT BEEN OBSERVED
p260_269 SHE HAS FALLEN IN LOVE WITH SCOTLAND HOWEVER

p260_290 PAINFUL BUT ONLY BECAUSE IT'S TRUE

p261_001 PLEASE CALL STELLA
p261_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p261_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p261_017 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
p261_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p261_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p261_044 I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE HIM HOME
p261_056 WE WILL PAY THEIR BILLS
p261_062 I WISH I HAD PUT ON A BRIGHTER TIE
p261_067 THAT'S NOT THE INTENTION AT ALL
p261_068 IT STARTS WITH THE SCRIPT
p261_084 POTIONS SAID HE WOULD DRIVE
p261_088 IT IS HIGH TIME TO ACT
p261_090 HOWEVER ON THIS SHOWING IT'S GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT TASK
p261_091 WE COULD NOT GET ANY POSSESSION
p261_101 BEFORE THE GAME WE WENT FOR A PINT
p261_103 OUR HOUSE WAS VERY SMALL
p261_104 IT WAS A FUNNY GAME
p261_107 SO DID SHE MEET HIM
p261_112 IT BECAME A NATIONAL NETWORK
p261_113 HE THOUGHT SHE WAS AMAZING
p261_120 I WAS DEEPLY SADDENED BY THE DEATH OF DONALD DEWAR
p261_123 THE DEAL WAS PRESENTED YESTERDAY AS A MERGER
p261_126 THAT WOULD OPEN THE GATES OF HELL
p261_127 HE CAN PERFORM WELL UNDER PRESSURE
p261_128 I HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE
p261_130 HE IS A GREAT ADDITION TO OUR TEAM
p261_133 THIS WOULD INDICATE A SURGE IN INFLATION WAS UNLIKELY
p261_147 THE PETITION WAS FORMALLY PRESENTED AT DOWNING STREET YESTERDAY
p261_148 CRUCIALLY THOUGH UNITED WERE STILL ALIVE
p261_149 THE POINT IS RAISED AGAIN THAT EVENING AT THE ASSEMBLY ROOMS
p261_150 IT WAS BY THE NUMBERS
p261_154 THIS MIGHT SEEM LIKE AN OUTRAGEOUS ASSERTION
p261_155 THE STRONG POUND ALSO TOOK ITS TOLL
p261_156 THESE DAYS ARE LONG GONE
p261_160 WE KNEW WE HAD THE GOAL WE WANTED
p261_163 YOU HAD TO GO AND SEE HIM
p261_164 LAST WEEKEND IN GERMANY HE MISSED THE CUT
p261_165 NEXT YEAR IT PLANS TO OPEN AN OFFICE IN TOKYO
p261_169 ARE YOU GOING TO WIN
p261_173 THIS IS NO REFLECTION ON RANGERS
p261_178 IT IS NOT EITHER NATIONAL STANDARDS OR LOCAL CONTROL
p261_181 THESE MEN COULD BE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
p261_182 I WILL BE IN SCOTLAND
p261_183 SAYS THE DUKE OF YORK
p261_184 EQUALLY HE IS GRATEFUL TO HAVE SURVIVED THE CULL
p261_193 IT HAD BEEN IN PLACE SINCE LAST JULY
p261_204 IT WAS HIS OWN DECISION
p261_209 WHO WAS SHE
p261_210 A DEADLINE IS STILL ESSENTIAL
p261_214 THEY ARE LOOKING AT A FLOTATION
p261_220 IT HAS BEEN LIKE THAT ALL YEAR FOR ME
p261_234 A SMALL NUMBER OF NEW JOBS WILL ALSO BE CREATED
p261_244 I HAVEN'T MADE THE DONATION YET
p261_249 I WAS JUST A KID
p261_255 THAT IS THE CONSISTENT APPROACH OF THE GOVERNMENT
p261_261 NO PRODUCTION CONTRACT IS YET IN SIGHT
p261_269 WAS EVERYTHING DONE TO SAVE PEOPLE
p261_274 HE SAID HE INTENDED TO PUSH FOR A JUDICIAL REVIEW
p261_286 THEY CAN LEAVE AT ANY TIME
p261_289 HE HAS NOT CREATED A FESTIVAL RESOURCE
p261_292 IT WOULD CREATE A SCOTTISH SECRETARY WITH A LOT OF WEIGHT
p261_306 THE PARTNERSHIP WAS SET UP DURING THE SUMMER
p261_308 SURELY THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT IS ENTITLED TO TAKE A VIEW ON THAT
p261_310 SIZE IS NOT THE ISSUE
p261_311 HE WILL ADDRESS THE NATION THIS EVENING
p261_312 THEY HAVE SHOWN A GREAT DESIRE AND ATTITUDE
p261_313 TONY BLAIR SAID AS LITTLE
p261_319 THE CASTING IS AS PERFECT
p261_327 CAST AWAY NOW ON GENERAL RELEASE
p261_330 YOU WILL NEVER GET A CONVICTION
p261_338 BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN HIT BY INJURY
p261_344 SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
p261_358 THERE WAS SOME MERIT IN THAT
p261_359 THAT IS A TREND WHICH WILL BE ENCOURAGED
p261_365 HE WAS THEN REPLACED BY ROSS
p261_381 YOU DID NOT SEE IT
p261_388 HE MUST HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE
p261_400 IT WAS FIT FOR ROYALTY
p261_412 THE BREAKDOWN WAS MUCH LATER IN HER LIFE
p261_413 I TRIED TO BE CAUTIOUS BUT IT'S HARD IN THAT ROLE
p261_420 SMOKING IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT
p261_426 IT WAS IMPORTANT TO WIN THE SINGLES
p261_435 HE IS ON THE WRONG SIDE
p261_437 IT WAS THE CLIMAX OF THE THING
p261_440 IT WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE
p261_442 EVERYTHING IN GOLF IS A BALANCE
p261_449 HE DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE
p261_454 I REJECTED THE IDEA OF A SEPARATE RESIDENCE
p261_459 IT ALL BEGAN AS AN ACCIDENT
p261_460 LONG-TERM IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO
p261_461 IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO HAVE SOMETHING IN BLACK AND WHITE
p261_463 LET THAT BE THEIR MEMORIAL
p261_465 SHE WOULD TAKE THE FARMER TO THE OPERA
p261_472 IT'S BEEN A LONG LONG JOURNEY
p262_001 PLEASE CALL STELLA
p262_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p262_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
p262_024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
p262_032 THIS IS THE WINDOW
p262_033 PEOPLE LOVE TO SEE THIS STUFF
p262_039 IT WAS UGLY
p262_042 THE JUDGE SAID
p262_044 IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ALI
p262_046 I WAS ANGRY
p262_048 THEY HAD TO EXPLAIN IT
p262_054 ALREADY HE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS INFLUENCE IN THE DRESSING ROOM
p262_068 IT'S ALL I CAN DO
p262_080 OTHERWISE IT WILL COST A LOT OF MONEY
p262_082 IT'S NEVER TOO LATE
p262_086 TODAY I COULDN'T RUN ON IT
p262_089 THAT DEAL WILL BE DECIDED UNDER THE EXISTING RULES
p262_105 HE PLEADED FOR CAUTION
p262_113 UNTIL THE WEEKEND HE WAS MINISTER FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE
p262_124 OUR INTENTIONS ARE REAL
p262_127 ON FRIDAY THE HEADTEACHER AND DEPUTY HEADTEACHER APPEARED AT THE DOOR
p262_132 WE NEED TO CHAT
p262_133 SHE DIED AT HER HOME
p262_138 IT OPENS THE DOOR TO THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE
p262_144 MR BLAIR HAD DONE WELL
p262_145 WE ALSO ENJOYED A LOT OF SUPPORT
p262_158 THEY SAY THAT VITAL EVIDENCE WAS NOT HEARD IN COURT
p262_160 THEY ARE NOT ADVERTISED
p262_161 WE KNEW WE HAD THE GOAL WE WANTED
p262_175 WE WANTED IT LEFT FOR A WEE WHILE
p262_183 THEY NEED TO LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES
p262_184 MILLER WAS EVERY BIT AS HAPPY
p262_186 THAT WOULD BE MY VIEW
p262_189 WE MUST KEEP OUR FEET ON THE GROUND
p262_206 BUT I AM A WORRIED MAN
p262_213 I HAVE WANTED TO BUY ONE FOR THE NATIONAL GALLERY
p262_219 WE HAVE NOT GIVEN UP HOPE
p262_221 LOTTERY CASH IS RIGHTLY DEPENDENT ON GRASSROOTS APPROVAL
p262_223 IT'S A QUESTION OF CREATING A FUTURE AWARENESS
p262_229 IT'S THAT KIND OF PLACE
p262_230 BUT YOU THINK I'M GOING TO ARGUE WITH THE BIG MAN
p262_232 IT'S VERY SAFE
p262_235 BUT IT'S A SUBTLE PROCESS
p262_239 THIS GIVES A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO SWITCH
p262_241 IN FACT IT IS DEEPLY UNPLEASANT
p262_245 MANAGER BOBBY WILLIAMSON HAS NO INJURY WORRIES
p262_251 A FRIENDSHIP THAT WILL ENDURE
p262_253 HE SAID HE WAS IMPRESSED BY THE SET-UP AT CELTIC
p262_256 AT THE END OF THE DAY ONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL
p262_260 THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE HAD TO GET A WIN
p262_268 IT'S VERY NICE
p262_272 IT'S NOT EVEN FINISHED
p262_275 SADLY THE REVIVAL COULD NOT BE SUSTAINED
p262_281 SURELY THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT IS ENTITLED TO TAKE A VIEW ON THAT
p262_283 I SAW IT AT A RUCK
p262_289 THIS IS A NATIONAL CRISIS
p262_308 THEY SHOULD BE SWEPT AWAY
p262_313 FUNDING FOR THE SCIENCE CENTRE HAS COME FROM A NUMBER OF SOURCES
p262_317 SPECIAL MEASURES WERE NEEDED
p262_325 MY BODY IS CLEARLY CAPABLE
p262_334 IT COULD HAVE GONE EITHER WAY
p262_342 I WOULD MISS HIM
p262_350 I GOT A YELLOW CARD
p262_351 THERE IS NO LINK
p262_352 THE MAN WAS OBVIOUSLY DESPERATE TO GET AWAY FROM THE POLICE
p262_359 HE'S VERY EXPLOSIVE
p262_360 IT WAS ONE IN THE AFTERNOON
p262_364 IT WAS A DOUBLE TRAGEDY FOR THE FAMILY
p262_366 WE HAVE TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF TRUST WHICH IS NOT EASY
p262_368 I AM NOT WILLING TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ANY COUPLE
p262_369 TALKS ARE PROGRESSING
p262_370 THE EYE WAS BADLY CLOSED ON SUNDAY
p262_371 IT WAS A FUNNY GAME
p262_372 IT IS A LARGE NUMBER
p262_377 MENTALLY YOU HAVE TO BE TOUGH
p262_379 I WAS SO NERVOUS
p262_382 IT WOULD BE A MASSIVE BOOST FOR THEM
p262_390 IT WAS ON FIRE
p262_394 HIS REMARKS APPEAR TO HAVE HAD AN EFFECT
p263_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p263_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p263_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
p263_016 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
p263_017 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
p263_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p263_024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
p263_026 HOW ARE YOU SIR
p263_028 DO I HAVE A FAVOURITE
p263_057 IT WILL NOW TAKE OVER THE RUNNING OF THE ESTATE
p263_059 IT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN
p263_076 EVEN THE ONE SHE LOVED
p263_079 SO WHAT IS THE CAMPAIGN ABOUT
p263_080 AND DOES IT
p263_082 TWO ISRAELI CABINET MINISTERS WERE IN THE BUILDING AT THE TIME
p263_088 A PLAY IS A SET OF ACTIONS
p263_095 IT MIGHT CHANGE YOUR LIFE
p263_097 MR BLAIR SHOULD BE WARNED
p263_100 HOWEVER A DECISION SHOULD BE MADE BEFORE THE END OF AUGUST
p263_103 I SAW THE WHOLE THING
p263_108 OUR PREFERENCE IS TO PLAY IN MIDWEEK
p263_109 YOU ARE LIKE AN ANIMAL
p263_111 IT HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE OF FRUSTRATION
p263_112 THAT ALL HOPE IS NEVER LOST
p263_125 IT ISN'T A HAPPY MEMORY
p263_141 WHAT DO WE WANT TO DO THAT FOR
p263_144 THE TEMPERATURE IN THE TOWN IS VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL
p263_147 LOSING IN THAT MANNER IS VERY HARD TO TAKE
p263_149 AND THE FARMER IS WORRIED ABOUT ANOTHER ASPECT OF FARMING LIFE
p263_153 BUT THE COMMISSION IS ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH THE GOVERNMENT
p263_157 DRUGS ARE USED A LOT AT THE FISHING NOT JUST CANNABIS
p263_160 SHE WILL DO FOR ME
p263_168 THE OTHER BUSINESSES WERE BASED IN YORKSHIRE AND NORTHERN IRELAND
p263_172 THESE DAYS ARE LONG GONE
p263_181 THE DECISION WAS BLAMED ON WEAK INVESTMENT MARKETS
p263_183 IRVINE SAID HIS COMPANY WAS INTENT ON SUPPORTING THE SCOTTISH DAIRY INDUSTRY
p263_189 THE REGION IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS
p263_194 SAYS THE DUKE OF YORK
p263_198 YOU KNOW THE SORT OF THING
p263_211 WE MUST KEEP OUR FEET ON THE GROUND
p263_214 I CAME HOME BY AMBULANCE
p263_221 THE GUIDELINES ARE EXPECTED TO BE FINALISED BEFORE NEXT SPRING
p263_223 A DEADLINE IS STILL ESSENTIAL
p263_224 WE SEE THE RAPID REACTION FORCE AS THE WAY AHEAD
p263_236 PEOPLE SHOULD MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS
p263_243 THE BODY FOLLOWS THE MIND
p263_245 WE WILL CONTINUE TO TALK TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR SCOTTISH FOOTBALL
p263_252 IS IT IN THE RIGHT PLACE
p263_259 WE HAVE A FREE VOTE ON THESE THINGS IN OUR PARTY
p263_265 YOU CAN FEEL AT HOME IN CHINA
p263_269 IT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN A YEAR FOR A COMPANY THIS SIZE
p263_271 I DIDN'T SEE THE POINT
p263_272 IT SEEMS A SHAME TO LEAVE IT
p263_277 THE PROPERTY IS OWNED BY GLASGOW CITY COUNCIL
p263_281 THE WORK BETWEEN THE MUSICIANS AND THE FIRE IS VERY IMPORTANT
p263_284 I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE WAY HE JUMPED
p263_286 YOU GET A LOT FOR YOUR MONEY
p263_289 HE WAS ALSO MARRIED WITH TWO CHILDREN
p263_308 DO THEY THINK ANYONE ELSE WANTS THEM
p263_312 THE GOVERNMENT IS KEEN TO PROMOTE THE GROWTH OF FRIENDLY SOCIETIES
p263_317 IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WILL HAVE TO BE TACKLED
p263_326 THE FOLLOWING YEAR WAS A MISERABLE TIME FOR MR DEWAR
p263_329 THERE'S STILL A BIT TO GO
p263_331 FUNDING FOR THE SCIENCE CENTRE HAS COME FROM A NUMBER OF SOURCES
p263_335 HE WILL GO A LONG WAY
p263_338 THE PREMIER LEAGUE HAS BEEN A HUGE SUCCESS
p263_340 SHE IS ON A LIFE SUPPORT MACHINE
p263_351 OVERALL WE ARE VERY PLEASED
p263_352 IT WAS TOUGH TO CONTAIN THE EXCITEMENT
p263_358 WHETHER THIS RETURN WAS TOO SOON
p263_360 ON THURSDAY MR BLAIR WILL ADDRESS THE INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH
p263_361 HE WAS THEN REPLACED BY ROSS
p263_365 THERE IS A RANGE OF EMPLOYERS
p263_366 BUT WE WELCOME THIS DOCUMENT
p263_376 LIKE HIS ACTING IT WAS AN ACCIDENT
p263_378 THE MAN WAS OBVIOUSLY DESPERATE TO GET AWAY FROM THE POLICE
p263_379 A REPORT IS THE FIRST STEP IN A CRIMINAL CASE IN INDIA
p263_380 THIS VIEW WAS ECHOED BY THE OTHER SCOTTISH ANALYST
p263_382 THEY WERE TO BLAME FOR THE FIRST TWO GOALS
p263_387 BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE CLOSURE OF THE EXPORT MARKET
p263_399 REACTION FROM SCOTTISH BUSINESS LEADERS WAS MIXED
p263_403 WE FELT AT THE MOMENT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE
p263_407 THE CABINET IS SPLIT OVER THE ISSUE
p263_410 WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED
p263_419 I CAN LEAD BY EXAMPLE
p263_427 BUT WE ARE SEVERELY LIMITED IN FUNDS
p263_429 IT IS THAT SORT OF FILM
p263_448 IT IS NOT OVER BY ANY MEANS
p263_451 IT IS A TOUGH GAME BUT WE HAVE A CHANCE
p263_454 LEGAL OPINION IS THAT I MAY HAVE A CASE
p263_457 HE LOOKED ON THE DEAL AS A MERGER RATHER THAN A TAKEOVER
p263_459 IT GOES WITH THE JOB
p263_460 IT HAS BEEN A WASTE OF TIME
p263_461 THE REST OF THE BUSINESS IS VERY ROBUST
p263_465 IT WAS ANOTHER REMINDER OF THE POWER OF AN IMAGE

p264_289 YOU HAVE MADE YOUR POINT)
p264_292 IT'S JUST AN AREA OF WATER)
p264_293 RANGERS WAS ON THE AGENDA AND I AM INTERESTED)
p264_309 FIVE YEARS AGO ITS RETURN WAS REJECTED)
p264_310 HE LEFT PRETTY QUICKLY)
p264_316 THIS IS EXTREMELY POSITIVE NEWS)
p264_319 NOT ONE PERSON SPOKE BADLY)
p264_345 I BELIEVE THEY ARE DEAD)
p264_346 WE HAVE NO INFORMATION ON IRAQ)
p264_352 THAT WOULD CONCERN ME LOT)

p264_378 JOHN GAVE UP EVERYTHING TO BE WITH ME)

p264_452 THE OFFICIAL ALSO SAID NO GROUPS HAD MADE ANY TERRORIST CLAIMS INVOLVING THE CRASH)
p264_455 THEY THOUGHT HE WAS ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS)
p264_458 THE TECHNOLOGY LOOKS EXCELLENT)
p264_465 HE ENJOYED BEING WITH HIS FAMILY)
p264_466 IT'S A STRATEGY WHICH WOULD WORK BEYOND THIS SHOW)
p264_470 IT IS AN INDUSTRY FAILURE)
p264_473 IT'S A TOUGH OLD JOB TO GET FOR YOUR FIRST JOB)
p264_476 TELL US ABOUT IT)
p264_481 THE PARTIES INCLUDE THE SCOTTISH EXECUTIVE)
p264_483 YOUR BANK MAY OFFER YOU A CHOICE OF OPTIONS)
p264_487 HER FATHER WASN'T BEST PLEASED)
p264_493 HE ADDED THAT TRADING DATA FOR THE NEW STORES WOULD BE REVEALED IN DUE COURSE)
p264_494 THAT MEANS A BAN ON FRENCH PRODUCTS)
p264_495 THIS IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF DOUBLE STANDARDS FROM HEADQUARTERS)
p265_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p265_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p265_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p265_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p265_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p265_041 A NEIGHBOUR SAID
p265_042 AMONG THEM ARE MANY CRIMINALS
p265_046 THERE WAS NO SAFETY NET
p265_047 IT IS UNIQUE
p265_063 IT SHOULDN'T COME AS A SURPRISE BUT IT DOES
p265_064 NEITHER IT IS
p265_067 I WOULD THINK ABOUT THE END OF JANUARY THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY
p265_070 IT IS NOT LONG TERM BUT I NEED TIME TO RECOVER
p265_080 THE CITY COUNCIL IS A MAJOR PROPERTY OWNER IN THE AREA
p265_081 YESTERDAY HE CONTINUED TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE
p265_082 IT IS A LIFELINE
p265_092 HOWEVER THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT AT THE SOUTHERN GENERAL HOSPITAL WAS FULL
p265_094 THEY TRIED TO DENY IT
p265_095 WE HAVE AN ELECTION IN EIGHT DAYS
p265_098 SHE REFLECTS A BIT
p265_105 IT WAS THE EIGHTIES
p265_111 THERE WILL BE A BEGINNING A MIDDLE AND AN END
p265_114 HOLLAND WON BY FIVE WICKETS
p265_124 ON FRIDAY THE HEADTEACHER AND DEPUTY HEADTEACHER APPEARED AT THE DOOR
p265_126 IT IS A TIME BOMB
p265_136 HE SETS THE NATURE OF HIS PARLIAMENT IN A SIMPLE REALISTIC CONTEXT
p265_142 THEY HAVE NOT BEEN NAMED
p265_151 SHE IS AN EXPERT ON MEDICAL ETHICS
p265_154 IT IS NOT LIKE US
p265_159 IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY WHETHER A PUBLIC INQUIRY WOULD BE APPROPRIATE
p265_166 HE DESERVED THE WIN
p265_169 THEY KNOW NO OTHER WAY
p265_171 IT'S AN IDEA
p265_172 AND SHE IS A SUCCESSFUL ACTOR WITH THREE DECADES OF EXPERIENCE
p265_175 THEY NEED TO LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES
p265_179 I PUT THE DRAWING DOWN
p265_180 ANY CHANGE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT'S APPROVAL
p265_190 THE GUIDELINES ARE EXPECTED TO BE FINALISED BEFORE NEXT SPRING
p265_191 THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR IS AWAY ON HOLIDAY
p265_202 SO FAR THE SCHEME HAS NOT BEEN USED IN SCOTLAND
p265_209 BUT SHE WAS
p265_218 HER CONDITION WAS YESTERDAY DESCRIBED AS CRITICAL BUT STABLE
p265_231 IT WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN A GOOD FILM BUT VERY DIFFERENT
p265_234 IN FACT IT IS DEEPLY UNPLEASANT
p265_239 IN THE MEANTIME THE FANS WOULD SETTLE FOR A DERBY WIN
p265_244 I'VE HAD NO DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CHAIRMAN OR THE BOARD
p265_246 FOR THE SCOTTISH JUDGES THE AFFAIR IS VERY DELICATE AND UNIQUE
p265_249 CHELSEA WAS A GREAT CLUB
p265_252 UNTIL RECENTLY SHE WORKED AS A RECRUITMENT CONSULTANT IN LONDON
p265_279 YET IT WORKED
p265_291 THEY INCLUDED CERTAIN INSURANCE POLICIES AND HIS SHARE OF THE HOUSE
p265_294 YOU ARE THE GLORY
p265_295 THE MINISTER IS THE ENGINEER
p265_298 IS THERE ON HIS HANDS
p265_301 HORSES ARE DRAWN BY BALLOT
p265_302 MY BODY IS CLEARLY CAPABLE
p265_308 EITHER TEAM WILL BE HARD
p265_309 BUT NO SUCH AMENDMENT HAS BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT
p265_314 IN ADDITION CERTAIN AREAS ARE CLOSED AT CERTAIN TIMES
p265_324 THEY SHOULD TAKE THEIR MOBILE PHONES
p265_325 FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW THE PLAYER IS FREE TO LEAVE
p265_327 TELL US ABOUT IT
p265_329 BUT WE FINISHED THE SHOW
p265_330 BOTH OF THOSE PROMISES HAVE ALREADY BEEN HONOURED
p265_336 INSTEAD HE WAS INFORMED TO JOIN THE LINE OF CREDITORS
p265_338 THAT WOULD HELP
p265_345 WE HAVE TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF TRUST WHICH IS NOT EASY
p265_347 THE FINAL DECISION WAS BETWEEN SCOTLAND AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND
p265_350 SO THERE WE WON
p265_352 I'M NOT GOING TO GET UPSET BY TWO COMEDY PROMOTERS
p266_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION
p266_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p266_010 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
p266_017 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
p266_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p266_024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
p266_026 SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES ARE ALSO REPORTED TO BE INTERESTED IN THE FORMAT
p266_037 INDEED HE DOES
p266_038 PEOPLE COME INTO THE BORDERS FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE BACKGROUND
p266_060 CHARLES KENNEDY HAD AN EFFECTIVE OUTING
p266_065 PAINFUL BUT ONLY BECAUSE IT'S TRUE
p266_070 CHRIS SMITH THE CULTURE SECRETARY SAID HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE DECISION
p266_079 HE IS IN THE QUEUE
p266_093 TWO OTHER MEN INCLUDING THE TAXI DRIVER WERE WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK
p266_097 I SAW THE WHOLE THING
p266_107 NOW THOUGH HE BELIEVES THAT THE NEW FORMATION HAS HELPED HIS FORM
p266_118 I DID NOT SEE ANY REASON TO CHANGE THE CAPTAIN
p266_125 I'M SO ANGRY
p266_131 THE JUDGES WILL GIVE A RULING NEXT WEDNESDAY
p266_133 NOBODY WILL KNOW THE FEELING OF THE BRANCHES UNTIL OCTOBER
p266_142 SHE DIED AT HER HOME
p266_154 THEY HAVE NOT BEEN NAMED
p266_163 COUNCILLORS ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE A DECISION WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS
p266_164 WE NEED A NEW KIND OF THEATRE
p266_173 IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY WHETHER A PUBLIC INQUIRY WOULD BE APPROPRIATE
p266_180 ALMOST THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION THE BATTLE LINES WERE DRAWN
p266_191 IT'S A COMMISSION AND IT'S FOR WORK A YEAR'S WORK
p266_192 I CAME HOME BY AMBULANCE
p266_193 THE MODERN APPROACH WILL ALSO BE REFLECTED IN THE TERMS OF ADDRESS
p266_194 IS THAT SUCCESS
p266_197 THE GUIDELINES ARE EXPECTED TO BE FINALISED BEFORE NEXT SPRING
p266_200 IT'S JUST AWFUL
p266_202 IT'S A QUESTION OF CREATING A FUTURE AWARENESS
p266_210 HE SEEMED TO LOSE HIS FOCUS
p266_213 ON A TECHNICAL LEVEL THEY WERE NOT AFRAID TO PLAY GOOD FOOTBALL
p266_215 DURING THE COMMUNIST TIME THEY WERE VERY PRIVILEGED
p266_224 THE REPORT IS DUE OUT NEXT MONTH
p266_231 IT'S QUITE NICE
p266_236 IN FACT IT IS DEEPLY UNPLEASANT
p266_240 THE SCENE IS ABOUT THIS
p266_243 MY SON WAS TOO YOUNG TO DIE
p266_255 HOWEVER IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT OFFERS OF FURTHER PAYMENTS ARE UNLIKELY
p266_259 HOWEVER THE FORCE HAS NOT YET RECEIVED A FORMAL COMPLAINT
p266_260 SOUTER WILL BE BACK
p266_282 SURELY THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT IS ENTITLED TO TAKE A VIEW ON THAT
p266_284 DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE IS CURRENTLY ON GENERAL RELEASE
p266_289 IT WAS GOOD
p266_292 IT CAME AS A SURPRISE BECAUSE MY JOB IS TO GO BACKWARDS
p266_296 SPENT THREE MONTHS ALONE AT SEA
p266_298 THERE WAS A VACUUM
p266_306 I CAN GIVE NO COMMENT
p266_307 BUT THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN IS A MILITARY CAMPAIGN AGAINST OSAMA BIN LADEN
p266_308 THIS IS A WAR OVER OUR HOME
p266_310 THE PLOT IS MINIMAL
p266_312 YOU SHOULD BE
p266_314 I WILL NOT ALLOW THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SCOTTISH FISHING INDUSTRY
p266_321 IN ADDITION CERTAIN AREAS ARE CLOSED AT CERTAIN TIMES
p266_323 WE ARE IN THE END GAME
p266_326 THEY WILL CERTAINLY BE VISIBLE FROM EVERY HOUSE IN OUR AREA
p266_344 YET FOR MY MONEY HE WAS NOT THE MAN OF THE MATCH
p266_346 IT IS LONG GONE
p266_348 TELL US ABOUT IT
p266_351 RANGERS CAN EXPECT A PHYSICAL BATTLE IN THE NATIONAL STADIUM TONIGHT
p266_353 SHE IS FREE
p266_355 YOU MUST HAVE A GOVERNMENT AND A GOOD CIVIL SERVICE
p266_357 YOU HAVE TO RELY ON EACH OTHER
p266_358 IT WAS ONE IN THE AFTERNOON
p266_362 OTHERWISE IT WILL COST A LOT OF MONEY
p266_364 NOT SO IT SEEMS
p266_365 HE WAS ALSO A GREAT MAN
p266_368 HE HAS BEEN IN A NURSING HOME FOR TWO YEARS
p266_369 IT'S NOW DOWN IN BLACK AND WHITE
p266_370 TWADDLE IS A CASE IN POINT
p266_377 THE TASK IS ENORMOUS
p266_382 OF COURSE WE WILL NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE SQUAD FOR EUROPE
p266_385 SINCE THEN HE HAS PLAYED NO ACTIVE PART IN THE COMPANY
p266_398 WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SUMMER
p266_399 THANKFULLY NO-ONE ON THE BUS IS TOO BADLY HURT
p266_400 BUT IN FACT THE REVERSE IS TRUE
p266_403 SO I DID
p266_412 IN THAT CASE WE WOULD BE PREPARED TO DEFEND OURSELVES
p266_414 BUT WE FINISHED THE SHOW
p266_418 THAT MAY BE
p266_420 PARIS IS NOT ONLY YOUNG
p266_422 IT LOOKED LIKE A WAR ZONE
p267_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p267_004 WE ALSO NEED A SMALL PLASTIC SNAKE AND A BIG TOY FROG FOR THE KIDS
p267_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
p267_025 A SHORTLIST IS TO BE DRAWN UP NEXT MONTH
p267_026 HE MAY NOT NEED TO FORCE THAT MESSAGE
p267_027 THERE IS NO REASON AT ALL
p267_034 I BECAME A WIDOW OVERNIGHT
p267_043 EVERYTHING ELSE IS A BONUS
p267_046 PULLED A HUGE NUMBER OF VIEWERS
p267_052 I MUST TAKE A SEAT
p267_058 IT'S JUST THE TIMING OF THE GAME
p267_073 HALIFAX HAS ALSO BEEN MENTIONED AS A LIKELY PREDATOR
p267_079 BY THEN HE WAS WALKING ON WATER
p267_080 IT'S SO HARD TO SHIFT
p267_081 THEY LIVED FOR THEIR CHILDREN
p267_087 A YEAR AGO SHE WAS JUST A JUNIOR MINISTER AT THE TREASURY
p267_088 IT'S FOR THAT REASON HE SHOULD RESIGN
p267_100 THEY WILL NOTICE A DIFFERENCE
p267_102 SUCH ACTIONS ARE RARELY POPULAR
p267_115 WHAT KIND OF MAN DOES THAT MR DICK
p267_124 IT WOULD MAKE A LOT OF SENSE
p267_127 ALICE THE GIRL WAS SAID BY DOCTORS TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION
p267_128 THEY SCORED WITH A PENALTY AND A BREAKAWAY
p267_134 I AM JUST TRYING TO DO MY JOB
p267_142 SHE HAD GONE TO THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL
p267_148 THERE WAS A DEFINITE PREJUDICE
p267_168 I ALWAYS FELT THEY PLAYED FOR ME
p267_175 I WOULD NOT COUNT ON IT
p267_176 HE PLAYED IT LIKE A VETERAN
p267_177 I HAVE SPOKEN TO HEAD OFFICE
p267_179 THE EUROPEAN UNION IS A CASE IN POINT
p267_181 IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM
p267_184 IT WAS ONLY LATER THAT THE CONDITION WAS DIAGNOSED
p267_187 PEOPLE WILL ASK ABOUT US
p267_195 I SUGGEST A NEW PLAN
p267_207 TODAY WE MUST NOT REPEAT THAT MISTAKE
p267_217 IT IS GOOD FOR OUR TEAM
p267_221 WOMEN WERE MOSTLY NOTABLE BY THEIR ABSENCE
p267_231 I DIDN'T PLAY TOO WELL IN THE THIRD QUARTER
p267_232 A SMALL NUMBER OF NEW JOBS WILL ALSO BE CREATED
p267_233 MY WIFE AND FAMILY ARE THE SUPPORT SYSTEM
p267_236 PENSIONS ARE A LONG-TERM INVESTMENT
p267_248 IT MIGHT BE SAD BUT IT'S A FACT
p267_250 IT SEEMS A WASTE OF TALENTS
p267_260 TOURISM IS A VITAL INDUSTRY FOR SCOTLAND
p267_261 THERE WILL BE WIDESPREAD SUPPORT ON ALL SIDES
p267_264 I CAN'T GET A JOB
p267_270 IT IS ALSO VERY VALUABLE
p267_271 IT DISAPPEARED INTO THE CUP
p267_272 THE STAGE WAS SET FOR A SHOWDOWN
p267_273 NOT MANY COMPANIES CAN SAY THAT THESE DAYS
p267_278 IT IS SET IN PARIS
p267_281 HE WAS ALSO MARRIED WITH TWO CHILDREN
p267_289 DO I THINK ABOUT THEM OFTEN
p267_291 THEY WERE ON HOLIDAY IN EGYPT
p267_293 WE HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE
p267_294 I FELT LIKE I WAS A CHILD
p267_295 CERTAINLY THE TALIBAN REGIME IS FINISHED
p267_301 THAT IS THE GENERAL FEELING
p267_306 DISRUPTION WILL BE KEPT TO A MINIMUM
p267_309 CAST AWAY NOW ON GENERAL RELEASE
p267_312 THERE WERE NO PASSENGERS ON BOARD
p267_313 YOU WILL NEVER GET A CONVICTION
p267_317 I AM NOT CONCERNED WITH PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC
p267_329 IT'S NOT AN EASY LIFE
p267_353 LAST NIGHT HE PLEDGED TO CLEAR HIS NAME
p267_354 SOME WILL BE DEPLOYED ON SUBMARINES
p267_356 IT INTENDS TO DO SO ON WEDNESDAY
p267_360 GEORGE MITCHELL IS TRYING TO CLOSE THE GAP
p267_361 THEY HAVE CREATED A BUSINESS
p267_364 THERE MAY BE REASONS FOR IT
p267_369 THERE IS NO DEAL AS YET
p267_370 YOU MUST HAVE A GOVERNMENT AND A GOOD CIVIL SERVICE
p267_371 TO HAVE PRODUCTS FOR THEIR NEEDS
p267_374 THE MARSHALL AT THE TURN WAS GREAT
p267_387 THEY LIKE BEING ON THE FRONT PAGES OF THE NEWSPAPERS
p267_390 I TRIED TO BE CAUTIOUS BUT IT'S HARD IN THAT ROLE
p267_393 MS MCNEILL WAS KILLED ON IMPACT
p267_395 WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED
p267_406 I THOUGHT HE WAS AN ANIMAL
p267_408 WE WILL STAND FOR THE NATION
p267_412 MY AIM IS A TOP SIX FINISH
p267_415 HE IS ON THE WRONG SIDE
p267_420 I'VE GOT MY OWN IDEAS
p268_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p268_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p268_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p268_033 FURTHER MANAGEMENT CHANGES ARE PLANNED
p268_036 WE ARE OPENING AN INQUIRY
p268_037 HE WORKS AT THE AIRPORT
p268_038 WHY DO YOU WANT TO COME TO EDINBURGH
p268_040 SO IS THAT IT THEN
p268_062 HE LOOKS LIKE AN AFGHAN
p268_069 PULLED A HUGE NUMBER OF VIEWERS
p268_071 A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE LAW SOCIETY OF SCOTLAND SAID
p268_075 LET'S HOPE THAT IT DOES
p268_078 WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO COPE
p268_080 AUTUMN IS THE TIME OF FULFILMENT
p268_090 I AM GLAD I WASN'T IN IT
p268_093 FINAL PROPOSALS WILL BE PUBLISHED IN FEBRUARY
p268_112 WE HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT DOING LOTS OF THINGS
p268_116 HARROWING IS EASY AFTER ALL
p268_119 THEY WOULD BE SUPPORTED BY VISITING SPECIALISTS
p268_120 THE ETHOS OF THE SCHOOL WAS OUTSTANDING
p268_125 MCPHERSON CAME FROM UNITED BISCUITS
p268_134 BROWN ALSO BELIEVES IN WALKER'S INNOCENCE
p268_141 COLIN SAID YOU GET THROUGH THE DAY-TO-DAY BY LOOKING AT THE FUTURE
p268_145 WHAT DO WE WANT TO DO THAT FOR
p268_147 HOW DO YOU GET IT BACK
p268_155 PROSPECTS FOR EQUITY MARKETS REMAIN UNCERTAIN
p268_160 WE FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE IN THIS INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT
p268_168 WE HAVE REACTED WELL TO EACH OTHER
p268_171 WHAT WAS THE MATTER FOR CONCERN
p268_176 AMONG THEM WAS GARY ROBERTSON FROM DUNDEE
p268_183 THE HEARING WAS DUE TO CONTINUE TODAY
p268_185 THE CULTURE IS EXTREMELY WIDESPREAD AND VIBRANT
p268_186 THAT WAS JUST ONE NIGHT
p268_190 SLOPPY ANSWERS ARE TO BE AVOIDED
p268_194 LEE WESTWOOD HAS OTHER IDEAS
p268_199 THIS PATTON WILL ALSO RETURN
p268_200 BUT HE ADMITTED HE COULD NOT SPEAK FOR THE NEW OWNER
p268_216 THE MUSIC IS THEREFORE PROFOUNDLY SUBVERSIVE
p268_223 IT OPENS THE DOOR TO THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE
p268_227 HE WANTS TO BE COMPETING FOR TITLES AND MEDALS
p268_231 FINDING SUITABLE REPLACEMENTS WOULD NOT BE EASY
p268_234 KINGFISHER REPORTS INTERIM FIGURES TOMORROW
p268_235 THEY'VE GOT SOME EXTREMELY GOOD PLAYERS
p268_247 THE BEST THING FOR ME WAS TO JOIN THE ARMY
p268_250 THEY SHOULD STOP THE BOMBING
p268_257 BIN LADEN WAS NOT MENTIONED
p268_263 THE SHOPPERS KNEW IT BEFORE CITY INVESTORS DID
p268_266 WE BELIEVE IN THE MEDIUM TERM
p268_270 IN THE EVENT IT PROVED A LARGELY UPLIFTING EXPERIENCE
p268_277 FIRST THE PROGRAMME WAS UNBALANCED
p268_278 THE HAPPINESS WAS SLIGHTLY MISPLACED
p268_298 IT COULD BE DONE BY EXPERTS AND LAWYERS
p268_300 ABERDEEN HAD LITTLE TO OFFER
p268_304 THEY WILL PROBABLY COME BACK
p268_310 YOU WERE AN EASY TARGET AND THEREFORE AN EASY SACRIFICE
p268_318 INDEED HE SEES A SHORTAGE OF SKILLED WORKERS ON THE HORIZON
p268_328 IT PARTICULARLY INCREASES UNDER-AGE DRINKING HE CLAIMED
p268_331 WE HAVE AN ELECTION IN EIGHT DAYS
p268_332 FLANKER GORDON SIMPSON MAY ALSO FEATURE IN THAT MATCH
p268_344 DOES IT MATTER
p268_348 HAVE I REALLY COME TO THIS
p268_349 FRIENDS SAID HE HAD SUFFERED A BLACKOUT TWO WEEKS AGO
p268_352 AND THE WORLD CUP HAS NOT EVEN BEGUN
p268_358 WE PLAYED THEM OFF THE PITCH
p268_362 THE STATEMENT CONTAINED NO SURPRISES
p268_363 THE PERFORMANCE CONTINUES TO IMPROVE
p268_370 HE ENDED UP A HEADMASTER
p268_371 HE LOOKED AT ME BEFORE REPLYING
p268_372 I HAVE LITTLE TIME FOR ANALYSTS

p278_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p278_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p278_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p278_038 AMONG THEM ARE MANY CRIMINALS
p278_047 SO IS THAT IT THEN
p278_052 HE ALSO PRESENTED YOU BET

p278_208 THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR IS AWAY ON HOLIDAY
p278_210 I WON'T MAKE AN OFFICIAL COMPLAINT
p278_221 JANUARY IS A BAD TIME OF YEAR
p278_223 TODAY WE MUST NOT REPEAT THAT MISTAKE
p278_227 DOES THE NAME MATTER
p278_240 THE STATEMENT CONTAINED NO SURPRISES
p278_244 THEY INCLUDED CERTAIN INSURANCE POLICIES AND HIS SHARE OF THE HOUSE
p278_248 A FATAL ACCIDENT INQUIRY WILL BE HELD INTO THE DEATH
p278_251 THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF CASUALTIES
p278_253 IT MIGHT BE SAD BUT IT'S A FACT
p278_258 DEFENSIVE STOCKS ATTRACTED SOME INTEREST
p278_262 PATERSON CAN AFFORD TO BE GENEROUS
p278_264 I'M PLEASED WITH SOME ASPECTS OF THE PERFORMANCE
p278_270 AND THEY WERE BEING PAID
p278_279 I'D NEVER RUN FOR THEM
p278_285 THIS COULD PUT PRESSURE ON UK INFLATION
p278_288 IT ALL STARTED WITH A VISITING RUGBY CLUB
p278_292 IT HAS BECOME A WAY OF LIFE
p278_296 THEY FAILED TO REACH AGREEMENT YESTERDAY
p278_297 THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US
p278_309 THEY HAVE SHOWN A GREAT DESIRE AND ATTITUDE
p278_313 MR CAMPBELL RECEIVED A PHONE CALL
p278_316 YOU HAVE ASKED FOR ACTION
p278_317 HOLLAND WON BY FIVE WICKETS
p278_318 CLYDESDALE BANK DECLINED TO COMMENT
p278_320 IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE RENEWED
p278_323 THE CASTING IS AS PERFECT
p278_326 MCNAUGHTON WAS NOT SO SURE
p278_331 THE WHOLE MATTER IS SOMEWHAT IN THE AIR
p278_332 MUCH THE SAME THING HAPPENS IN A YOUNG COMPANY
p278_334 THAT MEANT THE SEARCH WAS UNLAWFUL
p278_335 AND HE GOES WITH IT
p278_336 THAT REFLECTED A TUMBLE IN BANKING SHARES ACROSS THE BOARD
p278_342 WHAT FORM DID THAT TAKE
p278_344 IS THERE A WAITING LIST
p278_345 THE ADVISERS HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS BUT NO CONCLUSION WAS REACHED
p278_351 AND IT WAS THIS ONE
p278_352 SCOTTISH NEWCASTLE WILL REPORT ITS INTERIM FIGURES TOMORROW
p278_359 IN GENERAL TERMS THE PROPOSALS ARE VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS
p278_366 WE PUT OUR BID IN LAST NIGHT
p278_374 LORD MACDONALD HAS WORKED ON THIS DEAL FOR THREE MONTHS
p278_375 HE MUST HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE
p278_377 THE MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIPS WILL ALWAYS HAVE A SPECIAL PLACE
p278_378 THAT IS A BREAK WITH TRADITION
p278_388 THEY WILL FIGHT FOR EVERYTHING
p278_393 THE MARSHALL AT THE TURN WAS GREAT
p278_395 THEY HAVE NOT GOT ANYONE
p279_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p279_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION
p279_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p279_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p279_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p279_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p279_024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
p279_025 IT'S A RELIEF THAT A DECISION HAS FINALLY BEEN MADE
p279_026 HE SAID THE MATTER HAD BEEN NEGLECTED IN THE PAST
p279_029 IS THIS ACCURATE
p279_035 IT IS A MATTER OF THE UTMOST CONCERN TO THE ALLIES
p279_037 THEY'RE JUST DIFFERENT
p279_038 CLARK WAS DESPERATE TO RETURN TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
p279_042 I WAS SCARED
p279_044 IT WILL COME ALL RIGHT
p279_050 THE JUDGE SAID
p279_060 WE'VE GOT A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE LIONS
p279_068 THE PROBLEMS ARE A RESULT OF THAT SHORTFALL
p279_069 ART IS EXTRA
p279_074 HAVE A LOOK AT OUR ACCOUNTS
p279_079 HE HAD BEEN A SINGER
p279_081 THEY DO NOT WORK FOR GLASGOW CITY COUNCIL
p279_082 BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN HIT BY INJURY
p279_084 IS THERE A NEW WAY FORWARD
p279_085 IT WORKS FOR US
p279_086 IT IS A TIME BOMB
p279_090 FLORIDA IS THE PIVOTAL STATE IN THE NATION
p279_094 YET IT WORKED
p279_097 UNTIL YOU HIT THE BIG GAMES
p279_101 THE SELECTION PROCESS IS STILL AT A VERY EARLY STAGE
p279_102 HOWEVER WE HAVE NOT COME TO ANY CONCLUSIONS
p279_121 WHO WOULD HAVE
p279_128 CHILD ABUSE IS A DREADFUL THING
p279_131 WELL YOU CAN HAVE A TREE
p279_145 THAT COULD MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH IN ACTION
p279_147 I AM JUST TRYING TO DO MY JOB
p279_152 A FINAL DECISION WILL BE TAKEN BY FIRST MINISTER DONALD DEWAR
p279_162 AS INDEED THEY WOULD BE
p279_163 I HAVE GOT A WIFE TO FEED
p279_164 WE DO NOT COMMENT ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF OUR AUTHORS
p279_168 BY THEN HOWEVER BOTH MEN WERE ALREADY IN THE US
p279_180 THAT HAS BEEN THE EASY PART
p279_188 DOES THIS MATTER
p279_197 IT WAS TYPICAL
p279_199 THERE WOULD APPEAR TO BE NO MOTIVE FOR THE ATTACK
p279_206 I IN THE MEANTIME HAD BEEN FAR FROM CHILLING
p279_207 SOME REALISM WAS NEEDED ABOUT TIME RESOURCES AND MANAGEMENT
p279_211 THIS GIVES A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO SWITCH
p279_216 I AM DELIGHTED FOR SIMON
p279_234 POLICE LATER SAID THE SCHEME WOULD END IN NOVEMBER
p279_244 WE DID NOT COMPETE WITH ANY OTHER LOCAL FARMER
p279_247 WE WILL NEED TO STUDY THE REPORT BEFORE ANY DECISION IS TAKEN
p279_261 THE WORK BETWEEN THE MUSICIANS AND THE FIRE IS VERY IMPORTANT
p279_265 IT LOOKS AS THOUGH HE WILL BE RIGHT
p279_276 THEY SEEM TO GET AWAY WITH IT
p279_282 I INTENDED TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER CLUB ON LOAN
p279_283 YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE BOTH SIDES
p279_303 THEY ARE WRONG
p279_312 THE GOVERNMENT IN WESTMINSTER IS SIMPLY NOT PREPARED TO SAVE HIM
p279_320 HOPEFULLY HE WILL GET A LUCKY BREAK
p279_331 I'M SO PLEASED THE SHOW HAS WON A PRIZE
p279_339 THE BOAT WAS FANTASTIC
p279_340 I WAS PLEASED TO BE BACK ON THE PODIUM IN BRAZIL
p279_342 A FEW DAYS AFTER MAKING THE VIDEO I WENT TO THE INQUIRY
p279_344 THE MAN WAS OBVIOUSLY DESPERATE TO GET AWAY FROM THE POLICE
p279_345 THE SALARY CHANGES ARE LONG OVERDUE
p279_352 WE ARE LOOKING FOR PERFECTION
p279_353 IT'S NOT PRETTY BUT IT'S EFFECTIVE
p279_354 IT'S THAT SORT OF NIGHT
p279_357 I LOST MY HEAD
p279_362 SO THERE WE WON
p279_373 IT HAS BEEN A LOVELY FAMILY OCCASION
p279_375 YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A HEADACHE
p279_376 FAMILY LIAISON OFFICERS ARE NOW WORKING TO SUPPORT THE FAMILY
p279_377 WE HAVE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PLASTIC BAGS
p279_380 WE TRY TO KEEP IT RIGHT
p279_385 HE REPEATED HIS CALL FOR AN INQUIRY INTO THE POLICE RESPONSE
p279_386 HE IS ON THE WRONG SIDE
p279_389 IT WILL TAKE PLACE IN JULY
p279_393 HIS REMARKS APPEAR TO HAVE HAD AN EFFECT
p279_402 WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT
p281_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p281_004 WE ALSO NEED A SMALL PLASTIC SNAKE AND A BIG TOY FROG FOR THE KIDS
p281_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
p281_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p281_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p281_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p281_028 SMOKING IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT
p281_038 IT IS A FINANCIAL MATTER
p281_043 THERE'S BEEN A WAKE UP CALL FOR THE SECTOR THIS WEEK
p281_053 I MUST TAKE A SEAT
p281_063 THE STANDARD IS EXTREMELY HIGH
p281_081 I FIRST MET HIM LAST SUMMER
p281_085 HERE TOO THE POST OFFICE HAS MISSED THE BOAT
p281_088 THE CUT IS EXCELLENT NEWS FOR THE CONSUMER
p281_090 IT WAS WORTH A PHOTOGRAPH
p281_091 WE COULD NOT GET ANY POSSESSION
p281_092 OFFICERS RECOVERED A SECOND BODY IN THE AREA
p281_095 IT IS A VICIOUS CIRCLE
p281_098 WE LIVE BY THE RULE OF LAW
p281_101 THE FOLLOWING ARE THE PRINCIPAL PROVISIONS
p281_104 IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE A LENGTHY SERIES OF CLINICAL TRIALS
p281_107 WHAT DO WE DO
p281_111 THEY ARE AT A VERY EARLY STAGE
p281_113 OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
p281_117 I'VE HEARD THIS STUFF ABOUT THE MARKETS
p281_128 THAT IS FAR TOO HIGH
p281_135 WE WILL TRY TO FIND SOMEONE
p281_136 PEOPLE COME FROM ALL ROUND THE WORLD TO SEE IT
p281_145 THE FBI COULD BECOME INVOLVED
p281_149 IT IS NOT NORMAL PRACTICE
p281_154 SO WHAT IS THE CAMPAIGN ABOUT
p281_158 THIS YEAR THIS MONTH WILL BE SPECIAL FOR TORRANCE
p281_159 INSIDE THE ATMOSPHERE WAS QUIET
p281_168 NEXT YEAR IT PLANS TO OPEN AN OFFICE IN TOKYO
p281_172 THEY COULD NOT MATCH IT
p281_174 DO NOT IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT THEY ARE NOT THERE
p281_175 ONE SEASON THEY MIGHT DO WELL
p281_182 THE HOTEL WAS NOW FOR SALE
p281_191 I HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE
p281_198 IT DECIDED TO BLAME THE MEDIA
p281_204 THERE WAS NO WAY BACK FOR UNITED AFTER THAT
p281_216 YOU HAVE CAUGHT A SERIAL KILLER
p281_220 DOES THE NAME MATTER
p281_222 WHAT ARE YOU NOT GOOD AT
p281_233 ANYWAY THE JOB WILL BE PART-TIME
p281_235 I HAVE WANTED TO BUY ONE FOR THE NATIONAL GALLERY
p281_237 IT WAS A CRAZY DAY
p281_242 AFTER THAT NOTHING COULD SAVE HIM
p281_243 THIS IS THE YEAR OF THE TIGER
p281_250 THAT IS STILL IN PLACE
p281_270 THAT COULD BE IN PLACE BY NEXT YEAR
p281_271 ON THE CONTRARY THEY STAND TO GAIN
p281_272 HE LOOKED LIKE A SCHOOLBOY
p281_291 HE WAS ALSO MARRIED WITH TWO CHILDREN
p281_296 THE PARTNERSHIP WAS SET UP DURING THE SUMMER
p281_303 THE RESCUE PACKAGE IS PUBLIC MONEY
p281_304 WE ARE NOT DOING THE TODAY PROGRAMME
p281_308 THE REAL ISSUE IS PERSONAL
p281_310 DISRUPTION WILL BE KEPT TO A MINIMUM
p281_317 THE REPORT WILL GO BEFORE THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT PROBABLY IN EARLY AUTUMN
p281_326 THE WHOLE FAMILY WAS IN SHOCK
p281_336 THERE WAS NO TIME SCALE
p281_338 DID IT WORK
p281_339 DO YOU THINK WE ARE A TOP NATION
p281_340 IN HIS ABSENCE THE COUNCIL ADOPTED THE CHANGE
p281_344 ON THURSDAY MR BLAIR WILL ADDRESS THE INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH
p281_345 I HAVE A MORAL DILEMMA
p281_350 HE DID A GOOD JOB
p281_357 IT SHOULD BE A GREAT GAME THOUGH
p281_358 I SAID SHE WAS VERY YOUNG
p281_359 HE HAD NO PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS
p281_362 NEITHER WOMAN HAS BEEN NAMED
p281_365 I GOT A YELLOW CARD
p281_367 I BELIEVE THE GAP IS NEARLY THERE
p281_370 THEY WERE TO BLAME FOR THE FIRST TWO GOALS
p281_371 THERE IS NO DEAL AS YET
p281_373 THE SHARES ARE A STRONG HOLD
p281_380 I WANTED TO GO OUT ON A HIGH
p281_387 NOW THOUGH HE HAS AN INCENTIVE
p281_391 I WAS AS STRONG AS A HORSE
p281_396 DO THEY THINK ANYONE ELSE WANTS THEM
p281_397 THAT INVESTMENT HAS NOW BEEN SECURED
p281_403 THE CASUALTIES WERE NOT NAMED
p281_411 ONE DAY HE THREW THE BABY AGAINST A WALL
p281_413 HE SEEMS TO BE USED TO THE ATTENTION
p281_414 WE WILL STAND FOR THE NATION
p281_416 DOES IT MATTER
p281_423 THE CHARITY ALSO HAS A PROJECT IN MOSCOW IN RUSSIA
p281_427 IT WAS A POOR PERFORMANCE
p281_432 HE WILL BE JUDGED BY HIS ACTIONS
p281_451 WE HAVE THE LOCATION WHICH IS ASSURED
p281_455 SHE HAS NOW BEEN REGISTERED AS DISABLED
p282_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p282_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p282_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p282_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p282_025 BUT IT FAILED
p282_027 SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES ARE ALSO REPORTED TO BE INTERESTED IN THE FORMAT
p282_029 THEIR COURAGE AND THEIR HONESTY SHOULD BE RESPECTED
p282_030 THIS IS THE WINDOW
p282_033 THEN SUDDENLY THEY WEREN'T
p282_034 IT IS MARVELLOUS
p282_035 OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY WERE TOO UPSET TO COMMENT LAST NIGHT
p282_045 THEY WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED
p282_048 CHARLIE GORDON LEADER OF THE COUNCIL DISMISSED THE SUGGESTION
p282_050 A NEIGHBOUR SAID
p282_064 THAT'S THE TRUTH
p282_066 THIS IS THE FIRST STEP
p282_069 I AM PLEASED WITH THE RESULT AS IT WAS A POSSIBLE UPSET
p282_075 WE HAVE TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF TRUST WHICH IS NOT EASY
p282_076 I AM A SOLDIER A SOLDIER A SOLDIER
p282_077 IT IS A JOB CREATION SCHEME
p282_082 I WILL MISS HIM
p282_088 THEY LIVED FOR THEIR CHILDREN
p282_097 I LOVE THE DOME
p282_102 THEY MAKE A SELECTIVE PERCEPTION PROCESS
p282_109 WHILE THEY WENT ON HOLIDAY WE GOT THE CONTRACT
p282_115 IT WAS THE EIGHTIES
p282_127 SHE REALLY SUFFERED FOR HER ART
p282_129 IT IS NOT A U-TURN
p282_130 NO PRODUCTION WAS ACHIEVED
p282_131 I AM NOW UNEMPLOYED
p282_132 WE HAD A GREAT TIME WHEN WE CAME WITH EASY RIDER
p282_134 WE WORK WELL TOGETHER
p282_146 WHO WOULD HAVE
p282_164 I'D LOVE TO BE LIKE PETER
p282_172 IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY WHETHER A PUBLIC INQUIRY WOULD BE APPROPRIATE
p282_173 IN A WAY HE WAS
p282_187 OUR TEAM IS JUST SO YOUNG
p282_193 IT IS A FARCE
p282_201 IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY MONEY MONEY
p282_202 SADLY IT CAN'T
p282_203 IT WAS WORTH A PHOTOGRAPH
p282_208 TWADDLE IS A CASE IN POINT
p282_212 THE WORKERS DO NOT WANT TO READ ABOUT THEIR FUTURES IN NEWSPAPERS
p282_213 ON A TECHNICAL LEVEL THEY WERE NOT AFRAID TO PLAY GOOD FOOTBALL
p282_216 THIS OBSESSION WASN'T JUST CONTAINED WITHIN THE WORLD OF THE LOSERS
p282_219 IF IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T
p282_222 I'D NEVER SEEN A PLAY ABOUT ME
p282_233 OF COURSE I WAS TEMPTED
p282_242 IN SHORT THE SCOTTISH EXCESS IS NOT DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY
p282_243 MY SON WAS TOO YOUNG TO DIE
p282_247 CHILDREN SHOULD BE GIVEN THE SAME AMOUNT OF RIGHTS AS ADULTS
p282_254 ONE MP SAID HE FEARED THE JOB LOSSES WERE ONLY THE BEGINNING
p282_255 THEY MUST PLAY FOR EACH OTHER
p282_258 THIS COURT HAS MADE AN ORDER WHICH HAS NOT BEEN OBSERVED
p282_262 HE CLAIMED HIS INSURANCE COMPANY CONTESTED THE DAMAGES NOT THE RESTAURANT
p282_263 HE WAS ALSO MARRIED WITH TWO CHILDREN
p282_279 CERTAINLY THE TALIBAN REGIME IS FINISHED
p282_280 DIALOGUE IS THE KEY
p282_295 A POLICE INQUIRY BEGAN ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE GENERAL ELECTION
p282_296 THEY ARE WRONG
p282_298 THERE WERE NO PASSENGERS ON BOARD
p282_304 HOWEVER HE IS A COACH AND HE REMAINS A COACH AT HEART
p282_313 WE ARE IN THE END GAME
p282_315 I CAME INTO THIS WORLD WITH NOTHING
p282_316 THEY WILL CERTAINLY BE VISIBLE FROM EVERY HOUSE IN OUR AREA
p282_319 FEEL THE AIR THE SPACE
p282_328 LOCALLY TOO THE MP IS UNDER FIRE
p282_331 WE LOST OUR COMPOSURE TOWARDS THE INTERVAL HE SAID
p282_335 THEY SHOULD TAKE THEIR MOBILE PHONES
p282_340 BOTH OF THOSE PROMISES HAVE ALREADY BEEN HONOURED
p282_343 YET HE LEFT A FEW DAYS LATER
p282_347 INSTEAD HE WAS INFORMED TO JOIN THE LINE OF CREDITORS
p282_353 AND HE LAUGHS
p282_364 IT IS A SIMPLE EQUATION
p283_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p283_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p283_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p283_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p283_026 WE ARE A SERVICE INDUSTRY
p283_027 IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK OUT THAT WAY
p283_030 AND WE HAVE A SINGER
p283_043 THERE'S BEEN A WAKE UP CALL FOR THE SECTOR THIS WEEK
p283_053 THAT WAS THE THEORY ANYWAY
p283_054 I HAD COME BACK FROM LONDON
p283_055 I WAS INSPIRED BY TWO THINGS
p283_064 INSPIRING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IS CRUCIAL
p283_068 THE MOTIVE FOR THE SHOOTING WAS NOT KNOWN
p283_073 THERE WAS NO MENTION OF AN AMNESTY IN THE BELFAST AGREEMENT
p283_074 UNTIL RECENTLY SHE WORKED AS A RECRUITMENT CONSULTANT IN LONDON
p283_086 IT LOOKS LIKE A HIT
p283_087 I'D LIKE TO SEE THE BUSINESS CASE
p283_093 WE HAVE TO OFFER VALUE FOR MONEY
p283_096 POTIONS SAID HE WOULD DRIVE
p283_114 THEIR ATTITUDE IS ALL WRONG
p283_116 A YEAR AGO SHE WAS JUST A JUNIOR MINISTER AT THE TREASURY
p283_117 IT'S FOR THAT REASON HE SHOULD RESIGN
p283_120 THERE IS NO CREDIBLE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT
p283_126 IT WAS WON ON THE ISSUE OF THE LAND
p283_132 WE WOULD MAKE A START
p283_133 LADY THATCHER WAS THE ONLY WOMAN WITH FULL MEMBERSHIP
p283_139 WE DID WHAT WE HAD TO DO
p283_140 IF NOT A DEAL COULD TAKE MANY MONTHS
p283_142 LAST NIGHT THE ROW CONTINUED
p283_145 WE ARE ENTIRELY HAPPY WITH RUSSELL
p283_156 I AM JUST TRYING TO DO MY JOB
p283_158 IT HAS BECOME A WAY OF LIFE
p283_166 WAS IT THE WIFE
p283_182 I'D LOVE TO BE LIKE PETER
p283_184 I AM A GOOD PLAYER
p283_195 I FEEL LIKE MY GAME HAS COME A LONG WAY
p283_202 HOW DO YOU GET IT BACK
p283_212 WE ARE NOT MAKING ANY COMMENT
p283_222 PULLED A HUGE NUMBER OF VIEWERS
p283_226 YOU COULD FEEL THE HEAT
p283_228 THAT IS THE REAL TEST
p283_229 INDEED HE SEES A SHORTAGE OF SKILLED WORKERS ON THE HORIZON
p283_234 THE TICKETS WILL BE ON SALE TODAY AT THE TICKET OFFICE
p283_235 THIS WILL TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS
p283_236 THE RESEARCH IS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL NATURE
p283_237 WE HAVE AN ELECTION IN EIGHT DAYS
p283_241 THE PROPOSALS ARE TO BE DEBATED ON MONDAY BY CITY COUNCILLORS
p283_245 IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE
p283_250 FOR THE REFUGEES THE RETURN WILL NOT COME A MOMENT TOO SOON
p283_259 A SMALL NUMBER OF NEW JOBS WILL ALSO BE CREATED
p283_265 IT DEPENDS ON LABOUR NOT ON US
p283_267 SHE DIED IN MIDDLE AGE
p283_273 DID HE TRIP
p283_276 THE IRONY WAS NOT LOST
p283_284 YOU CAN NEVER TELL WITH THE MANAGER
p283_288 PATERSON CAN AFFORD TO BE GENEROUS
p283_289 MY SON WAS TOO YOUNG TO DIE
p283_295 WE ACCEPT THE NEW RULES
p283_300 I WOULD HAVE THE HAMMER IN THE CROWD
p283_303 IT IS THE END OF AN ADVENTURE
p283_307 IT WAS AN EASY DECISION TO COME HERE
p283_312 IT FURTHER EXPRESSED HIS DEFIANCE
p283_316 WE HAVE TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL
p283_318 IF NOT HE SHOULD GO HOME
p283_320 HOPEFULLY THIS WEEK WILL BE GOOD
p283_330 HE WILL ADDRESS THE NATION THIS EVENING
p283_334 IN EUROPE IT IS ALWAYS OVER TWO GAMES
p283_337 THE SONGS ARE JUST SO GOOD
p283_339 WE NEED TO INCREASE THE MEMBERSHIP
p283_340 A NEW SCHOOL WILL BE BUILT
p283_351 URGENT ACTION IS NEEDED TO TACKLE THIS CRISIS
p283_353 AND HE GOES WITH IT
p283_357 WE WANT TO PLAY AT THE WORLDS
p283_361 IT WILL DECIDE TODAY WHETHER HE SHOULD BE STRUCK OFF THE REGISTER
p283_362 IN THE OLD DAYS IT WAS EASY
p283_366 HE WAS AT SCHOOL IN DEVON
p283_368 I HAVE A MORAL DILEMMA
p283_371 I'M SO PLEASED THE SHOW HAS WON A PRIZE
p283_378 HE HAD NO PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS
p283_381 HAD THIS BEEN COMMON PRACTICE
p283_386 I BELIEVE THE GAP IS NEARLY THERE
p283_390 IT'S AS WIDE AS A CHURCH IN HERE
p283_398 THEATRE IS NOT A MUSEUM
p283_411 THANKFULLY PETER HAD ALREADY FOUND ANOTHER OUTLET FOR HIS TALENTS
p283_417 THE SECOND GOAL WAS SUPERB
p283_418 THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY
p283_422 I AM ASTONISHED AT ATTACK
p283_426 NO DATE HAS BEEN SET FOR A MEETING
p283_432 HE IS ON THE WRONG SIDE
p283_433 I WOULD RATHER LOOK AT HIM
p283_434 IT NEEDS TO BE VOLATILE
p283_448 SENTIMENT WAS HELPED BY THE SHARP FALL IN DEBT
p283_452 BUT WE HAVE BUILT A PLATFORM FOR NEXT SEASON
p283_466 THE EDINBURGH AUDIENCE WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE DIALOGUE
p284_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p284_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p284_027 IS THIS ACCURATE
p284_040 OF COURSE ON TUESDAY UNITED WERE BEATEN DESPITE THIS
p284_044 THE SHIFT IN PUBLIC PERCEPTION ABOUT THE DISEASE IS AMAZING
p284_048 OUR PEOPLE ARE READY
p284_052 FOR THE MEANTIME THOUGH THE SIGNS ARE GOOD
p284_053 MY FITNESS WAS VERY POOR
p284_054 SADLY IT CAN'T
p284_066 AND IF HE HADN'T BECOME A MUSICIAN
p284_076 THE PARTY IS UP FOR IT
p284_079 TODAY SHE HAS BEEN RELEASED
p284_091 SHE IS AN EXPERT ON MEDICAL ETHICS
p284_100 MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AT FAULT
p284_103 MEANWHILE THE SCOTTISH CONSUMER COUNCIL YESTERDAY OFFERED SUPPORT FOR THE NEW BILL
p284_104 THAT'S ALL RIGHT THEN
p284_106 BEFORE THE GAME WE WENT FOR A PINT
p284_107 SHE REFLECTS A BIT
p284_112 I WAS FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE I THOUGHT
p284_116 WE HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING BEFORE WE MAKE ANY FINAL DECISION
p284_118 MR CHISHOLM SAID THE MOVE WAS MADE ON THE ADVICE OF CONSULTANTS
p284_123 THERE WERE NO GROUNDS FOR HIS ACTION
p284_124 I CAN'T EVEN GET INTO THE A TEAM
p284_159 THESE DAYS ARE LONG GONE
p284_160 IT'S A LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE FORMULA
p284_162 THEY ARE NOT ADVERTISED
p284_164 IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR A FATHER ANYWAY AND I WAS FOREVER GRATEFUL
p284_175 EVERYONE CAN BE BOUGHT
p284_179 I SAW MILITARY VEHICLES IN THE DISTANCE
p284_183 OUR TEAM IS JUST SO YOUNG
p284_187 IT'S A COMMISSION AND IT'S FOR WORK A YEAR'S WORK
p284_191 THEY ARE READY
p284_200 THERE WAS AN E-MAIL
p284_204 IT IS PERFECTLY EVIDENT THAT THE TIME FOR AN INQUIRY WILL COME
p284_206 IT'S NOT IDEAL
p284_212 NATURALLY ENOUGH THE LETTER IN QUESTION WAS AN E
p284_213 THIS OBSESSION WASN'T JUST CONTAINED WITHIN THE WORLD OF THE LOSERS
p284_214 AT THE TOP OF THE STRUCTURE WILL REMAIN THE POST OF HEADTEACHER
p284_215 THE LOSS OF A COMPANY TO THE INDUSTRY IS A BLOW
p284_224 THE MOVE WAS ALSO WELCOMED BY THE NATIONAL UNION OF JOURNALISTS
p284_226 THEY TRIED TO GIVE HER ADVICE
p284_229 THERE IS NO EXCUSE
p284_237 YOU CAN FEEL AT HOME IN CHINA
p284_238 THE SCENE IS ABOUT THIS
p284_240 IT WAS A KIND OF CONTEMPT
p284_242 NOW SUDDENLY WE HAVE THIS NEW LANDSCAPE
p284_243 I SHOULD THINK SO TOO
p284_246 THERE WILL BE WIDESPREAD SUPPORT ON ALL SIDES
p284_262 PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE I HAVEN'T FINISHED THE FIRST TWO RACES
p284_270 HOWEVER HE WILL HAVE HIS WORK CUT OUT DEFENDING HIS TITLE
p284_280 THIS TIME FOR RANGERS IT IS CERTAINLY THE LATTER
p284_283 THEY HAVE SHOWN A GREAT DESIRE AND ATTITUDE
p284_284 MALONEY IS AN ENGAGING TALENT
p284_286 THIS IS A NATIONAL CRISIS
p284_289 NO BRITON HAS EVER WON
p284_299 I WAS THE SHEEP
p284_306 I CAN LIVE WITH IT
p284_313 WE WANT TO PLAY AT THE WORLDS
p284_314 THE GOVERNMENT IN WESTMINSTER IS SIMPLY NOT PREPARED TO SAVE HIM
p284_334 RELIEF WAS BEYOND BELIEF
p284_341 HE WAS THE ARCHITECT
p284_343 HE HAS TO LEARN
p284_348 A GREAT DEAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED
p284_351 THIS IS A SECTOR IN OVERALL DEFICIT AND URGENT ACTION IS REQUIRED
p284_354 I HAVE A DREAM
p284_357 I FIRST MET HIM LAST SUMMER
p284_361 YOU MUST HAVE A GOVERNMENT AND A GOOD CIVIL SERVICE
p284_362 YET HE LEFT A FEW DAYS LATER
p284_364 IT IS THE HOLIDAY PROGRAMME WITH A MORTGAGE
p284_365 TO DO SO HE RECKONS THAT A GOOD OPENING RESULT IS ESSENTIAL
p284_368 THERE WAS A SUBSTANTIAL EXPLOSION
p284_369 THEIR TIME HAS GONE
p284_370 ALL THE INVESTMENT IS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE PUBLIC SECTOR
p284_381 HE'S DELIGHTED TOO WITH THE NEW PREMISES
p284_384 I WAS LOST
p284_386 THE AWARD TO SENATOR MITCHELL WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE FOREIGN OFFICE
p284_387 THAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME THOUGH
p284_396 STEWART WILL TRAVEL WITH SOME CONFIDENCE
p284_403 BY THEN A MASSIVE LEGAL BATTLE IS LIKELY TO HAVE STARTED
p284_404 SO IN A SENSE IT WAS A GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY
p284_405 IT WILL TAKE PLACE IN JULY
p284_409 THEN HE LAUGHS
p284_418 IT IS LEGALLY BINDING
p284_420 HE WAS CONVICTED AT GLASGOW SHERIFF COURT
p284_421 ERIKSSON WOULD HAVE APPROVED
p285_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p285_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p285_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p285_016 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
p285_017 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
p285_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p285_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p285_024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
p285_029 THEIR COURAGE AND THEIR HONESTY SHOULD BE RESPECTED
p285_050 IT'S A MIRACLE
p285_051 I LOVE THE DOME
p285_057 SCOTLAND HAD GREAT ASSETS
p285_060 THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ANGER AND FRUSTRATION IN THAT MUSIC
p285_066 THE DEATH RATES ARE STILL AS HIGH
p285_069 I WOULD THINK ABOUT THE END OF JANUARY THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY
p285_078 I WAS TOO YOUNG
p285_085 YESTERDAY HE CONTINUED TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE
p285_096 HOWEVER THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT AT THE SOUTHERN GENERAL HOSPITAL WAS FULL
p285_103 SHE REFLECTS A BIT
p285_105 WHILE THEY WENT ON HOLIDAY WE GOT THE CONTRACT
p285_115 IT IS RUBBISH
p285_122 SHE REALLY SUFFERED FOR HER ART
p285_123 IT IS NOT A U-TURN
p285_126 HE'S DELIGHTED TOO WITH THE NEW PREMISES
p285_130 POLICE COULD NOT SAY IF THE TWO INCIDENTS WERE CONNECTED
p285_135 IT SEEMS SO LONG SINCE I DID THE EXAMS
p285_150 WE ARE ON A FOUR-YEAR MISSION
p285_153 MY DAD IS A HERO
p285_160 MILITARY ACTION IS THE ONLY OPTION WE HAVE ON THE TABLE TODAY
p285_161 AS INDEED THEY WOULD BE
p285_162 THE FIRST MINISTER IS SCHEDULED TO BE ELECTED BY THE PARLIAMENT TOMORROW
p285_165 TELL IT LIKE IT WAS
p285_188 ANY CHANGE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT'S APPROVAL
p285_189 THERE IS NO OPENNESS
p285_195 I CAME HOME BY AMBULANCE
p285_197 WE LIVE BY THE RULE OF LAW
p285_203 I DON'T WANT TO USE IT
p285_206 TWADDLE IS A CASE IN POINT
p285_207 IT'S NOT BEFORE TIME
p285_208 IT'S NOT IDEAL
p285_209 WE WANT TO KEEP THE POUND
p285_210 IN EACH CASE THEY WERE A GOAL DOWN
p285_214 PEOPLE SHOULD MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS
p285_222 CLEARLY THE STAKES ARE HIGH
p285_227 MY WIFE AND FAMILY ARE THE SUPPORT SYSTEM
p285_230 THEY TRIED TO GIVE HER ADVICE
p285_231 THE ROLE WAS A KNOCKOUT BUT REALLY DIFFICULT
p285_237 IT IS NOT AN OPTION BUT A POLICY REQUIREMENT
p285_242 WE LOST OUR COMPOSURE TOWARDS THE INTERVAL HE SAID
p285_243 I WAS AT THE BRITISH OLYMPIC MEDICAL CENTRE ON FRIDAY
p285_252 HE WAS MY BIG BROTHER MY FATHER MY GRANDFATHER
p285_253 FOR THE SCOTTISH JUDGES THE AFFAIR IS VERY DELICATE AND UNIQUE
p285_254 IT IS FANTASTIC THAT OTHER WOMEN WILL BE ABLE TO BENEFIT
p285_266 WE ARE HAPPY
p285_271 IT WAS VERY FAST
p285_274 I FEEL PRETTY GOOD
p285_278 HE LOOKED VERY SHARP
p285_288 HE ADDED THAT PUBLIC TRANSPORT IMPROVEMENTS MUST ALSO BE MAINTAINED
p285_289 WHO CAN PREDICT
p285_290 THERE WAS A VACUUM
p285_301 THIS IS A WAR OVER OUR HOME
p285_309 SHE IS VERY DISTINCTIVE
p285_310 WE ARE A PEACEFUL PEOPLE
p285_315 A REVIEW IS UNDER WAY
p285_316 IT WILL WORK
p285_339 OUR POLICY IS CLEAR
p285_345 THE MAN WAS OBVIOUSLY DESPERATE TO GET AWAY FROM THE POLICE
p285_348 MRS THATCHER WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME
p285_350 A SPOKESWOMAN FOR EDINBURGH CITY COUNCIL CONFIRMED ITS SUPPORT FOR THE COMPANY
p285_356 IN FACT WE WERE ALL OVER THE SHOP
p285_365 ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE IN FOOTBALL AND WE CAN BEAT CELTIC AGAIN
p285_374 I'M STILL AN AMATEUR IN THAT SENSE
p285_375 THE CABINET IS SPLIT OVER THE ISSUE
p285_378 YOU CAN COPE WITH IT
p285_386 THE CITY COUNCIL IS A MAJOR PROPERTY OWNER IN THE AREA
p285_389 WELL IT DID LAST TIME HE WAS REMINDED
p285_397 THE JURY IS EXPECTED TO RETURN A VERDICT IN THE CASE TODAY
p285_398 THANKFULLY NO-ONE ON THE BUS IS TOO BADLY HURT
p285_400 BUT IN FACT THE REVERSE IS TRUE
p285_402 THE ORCHESTRA WAS ALREADY INCREASING THE SCOPE OF ITS AMBITIONS
p285_403 EMOTIONS WERE COMPLEX
p286_004 WE ALSO NEED A SMALL PLASTIC SNAKE AND A BIG TOY FROG FOR THE KIDS
p286_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p286_010 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
p286_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p286_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p286_031 SHE IS EMPLOYED ON SHORT-TERM CONTRACTS
p286_033 I FEEL SO DESPERATELY SORRY FOR GORDON AND SARAH
p286_034 CLARK WAS DESPERATE TO RETURN TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
p286_038 YOU MUST ALWAYS ATTEMPT TO RAISE THE BAR
p286_046 PULLED A HUGE NUMBER OF VIEWERS
p286_048 MAYBE FULL-TIME REFEREES WILL PROVIDE THE ANSWER
p286_050 WE ARE A NEW DEPARTMENT
p286_055 DO I HAVE A FAVOURITE
p286_062 WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR CLIENTS
p286_065 UNTIL RECENTLY SHE WORKED AS A RECRUITMENT CONSULTANT IN LONDON
p286_066 IT IS A GREAT FEELING RIGHT NOW
p286_080 ENGLAND WERE AHEAD UNTIL TWO MINUTES INTO INJURY TIME
p286_084 HE HAS BEEN A SUCCESS THIS YEAR
p286_090 THEATRE IS NOT A MUSEUM
p286_091 WHY DO IT OTHERWISE
p286_093 SO DID SHE MEET HIM
p286_097 HAD I HEARD
p286_103 THE ALLEGATIONS WERE STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION HE ADDED
p286_105 THE OUTSOURCING DEAL WILL TAKE EFFECT IN SEPTEMBER
p286_111 IT'S NOT A HOLIDAY TIME FOR FOOTBALL PLAYERS
p286_112 HE WAS FORCED TO QUIT
p286_113 BUT I KNOW THE COURSE
p286_115 WE SHOULD RECOGNISE THAT OTHERS HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB
p286_118 WE NEEDED FINANCIAL BACKING TO GET IT OFF THE GROUND
p286_132 THEY WILL REMEMBER THIS VICTORY FOR A WHILE
p286_145 TIGER IS NOT THE NORM
p286_161 BEHIND HIM WAS HIS BROTHER
p286_163 THE FAMILY KEPT AWAY FROM ME
p286_168 WE DID WHAT WE HAD TO DO
p286_169 THE BANK WAS NOW INVOLVED
p286_174 NEXT YEAR IT PLANS TO OPEN AN OFFICE IN TOKYO
p286_179 THE SECOND ASPECT WAS THE FEAR OF FAILURE
p286_181 PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BECOME COMPLACENT
p286_189 IT APPEARS THAT IT WAS JUST A GENUINE MISTAKE
p286_192 THEY ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN ATTACKING LABOUR
p286_193 THEY NEED TO LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES
p286_219 WE SHOULD ALL BE GRATEFUL
p286_220 THE EARLY PHYSICAL REPORTS WERE CLEAR
p286_223 STEPHEN HAS NEVER CONSIDERED THE QUESTION OF COMPENSATION
p286_228 FLANKER GORDON SIMPSON MAY ALSO FEATURE IN THAT MATCH
p286_233 THESE THINGS HAVE NOT HAPPENED BY ACCIDENT
p286_252 PENSIONS ARE A LONG-TERM INVESTMENT
p286_259 THIS FACT IS SUPPORTED BY AUDIENCE RESEARCH
p286_262 KINGFISHER CAN AFFORD TO WAIT
p286_266 HIS IS A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
p286_267 EITHER WAY THE INVESTOR RETAINS THE PREMIUM
p286_278 WHAT WAS THE MATTER FOR CONCERN
p286_279 DO I THINK ABOUT THEM OFTEN
p286_280 IS IT IN THE RIGHT PLACE
p286_284 THEY MUST PLAY FOR EACH OTHER
p286_287 THERE'S NOT MUCH MONEY IN CYCLING
p286_291 INTERNET USERS WILL DOUBLE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS IN THE UK
p286_293 FRANKLY WE SHOULD ALL HAVE SUCH PROBLEMS
p286_298 FURTHER EXPANSION HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN GERMANY AND ITALY
p286_301 HOWEVER HE WILL HAVE HIS WORK CUT OUT DEFENDING HIS TITLE
p286_308 I COULDN'T REALLY WORK OUTSIDE EDINBURGH
p286_309 MOTHERWELL HAVE NO SUCH GOOD FORTUNE
p286_314 THE EFFECT WAS ALMOST MAGICAL
p286_317 AND THAT CULTURE IS EVERYWHERE IN DUBLIN
p286_322 I MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
p286_324 OUR MESSAGE TO THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE IS CLEAR
p286_329 A POLICE INQUIRY BEGAN ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE GENERAL ELECTION
p286_330 IT IS A ROAD OF DEATH
p286_337 SURVIVAL IS NOT AN OPTION
p286_341 THE ACTOR HAS MET WITH MANDELA
p286_344 IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE ISSUE WITH THE SCOTSMAN IS TOO SENSITIVE
p286_345 OTHER MUSICIANS WERE FOUND IN RETIREMENT
p286_346 IT IS A TERRIBLE STATE OF AFFAIRS
p286_350 ARE THEY FREE
p286_355 SCOTTISH NEWCASTLE WILL REPORT ITS INTERIM FIGURES TOMORROW
p286_359 MANY OF THESE PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
p286_360 I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE PLUNGE
p286_361 I HAVE A MORAL DILEMMA
p286_362 MY VIEW HAS NOW COMPLETELY CHANGED
p286_364 IN GENERAL TERMS THE PROPOSALS ARE VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS
p286_369 DO NOT FORGET ABOUT MONACO
p286_377 THEY WERE TO BLAME FOR THE FIRST TWO GOALS
p286_381 SHE IS OBVIOUSLY VERY DISAPPOINTED
p286_388 THAT TIME MAY NEVER BE BROKEN
p286_401 NOW THE LIFE OF THIS ORCHESTRA IS VERY DIFFICULT
p286_403 THIS BIG ISSUE IS WHETHER IT CAN BE ENFORCED
p286_413 THANKFULLY PETER HAD ALREADY FOUND ANOTHER OUTLET FOR HIS TALENTS
p286_417 GEORGE IS ON A TWO-DAY VISIT TO SCOTLAND
p286_424 IT WAS IMPORTANT TO WIN THE SINGLES
p286_429 I NEVER HAD A CHILDHOOD
p286_442 IT IS NEVER EASY TO WIN AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL
p286_451 THE JURY IS STILL OUT
p286_461 THEY ARE DEFINED BY LAW
p286_463 WE ARE NOW UP AGAINST IT
p287_004 WE ALSO NEED A SMALL PLASTIC SNAKE AND A BIG TOY FROG FOR THE KIDS
p287_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p287_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p287_010 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
p287_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
p287_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p287_016 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
p287_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p287_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p287_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p287_024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
p287_025 A SHORTLIST IS TO BE DRAWN UP NEXT MONTH
p287_029 HE HAS THE COURAGE OF THE UNAWARE
p287_030 LIFE WAS LIKE A TIMETABLE
p287_036 THIS REPRESENTS A TOUGH GAME FOR US
p287_043 HE WILL NEED THAT MACHINE
p287_048 THE TEACHER WOULD HAVE APPROVED
p287_054 IN TIME THE FIRST MINISTER WILL GROW IN STATURE
p287_057 WHY DO YOU WANT TO COME TO EDINBURGH
p287_059 SO IS THAT IT THEN
p287_064 FAMILY LIAISON OFFICERS ARE NOW WORKING TO SUPPORT THE FAMILY
p287_069 THAT WOULD BE TOO EASY
p287_072 AFTER FIVE WEEKS THE VEHICLE WILL BE SOLD AT AUCTION
p287_086 WE WOULD HOPE TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THAT NEXT YEAR
p287_090 TWO OF THE TEAM BECAME ILL
p287_093 BEFORE THE GAME WE WENT FOR A PINT
p287_097 IT'S NOT A LACK OF CONFIDENCE
p287_117 THEY MADE SUCH DECISIONS IN LONDON
p287_118 SHE WAS ALSO VERY BRAVE
p287_121 MY CONSCIENCE IS NOT CLEAR
p287_127 I MISS THE FREEDOM THAT I HAD
p287_130 THEIR PRESCRIPTION IS LARGELY ABOUT CHANGING ATTITUDES
p287_132 THAT IS THE REAL TEST
p287_143 WE WILL TURN THE CORNER
p287_152 YOU HAD TO GO AND SEE HIM
p287_161 THE HOTEL WAS NOW FOR SALE
p287_173 OUR DESTINY IS IN OUR OWN HANDS
p287_178 BEING INVESTOR READY IS A GOOD START
p287_179 THEY ALL MADE THE EUROPEAN RYDER CUP TEAM
p287_181 IT COULD BE DONE BY EXPERTS AND LAWYERS
p287_183 YOU KNOW THE SORT OF THING
p287_186 IT WAS A PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKE
p287_187 IT CAUSED A LOT OF UPSET
p287_195 IT COMES FROM REFLECTION OR THINKING
p287_197 THE SERVICE FROM THE OTHER PLAYERS WAS SUPER
p287_201 GETTING THIS RIGHT IS ESSENTIAL
p287_203 HOW DO YOU GET IT BACK
p287_206 WHO WAS SHE
p287_214 IT'S ALL CHANGE AT KILMARNOCK
p287_216 I HAVE WANTED TO BUY ONE FOR THE NATIONAL GALLERY
p287_223 IT WILL NOW TAKE OVER THE RUNNING OF THE ESTATE
p287_231 WE WERE A LOAD OF RUBBISH
p287_238 MY FUTURE IS IN THE MARATHON
p287_241 IT WAS A FAIRY TALE
p287_251 I SHOULD THINK SO TOO
p287_261 ON THE CONTRARY THEY STAND TO GAIN
p287_265 THEY MUST PLAY FOR EACH OTHER
p287_269 THE MORALE OF THE YUGOSLAV ARMY IS BEGINNING TO CRACK
p287_272 AND THEY WERE BEING PAID
p287_275 DO I THINK ABOUT THEM OFTEN
p287_279 INTERNET USERS WILL DOUBLE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS IN THE UK
p287_280 BROWN IS AN INTERESTING MAN BUT HE IS NOT DESPERATE
p287_283 IT WAS AN EASY DECISION TO COME HERE
p287_307 THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FOR THAT
p287_312 THIS WILL SECURE THE FUTURE OF OUR INDUSTRY
p287_316 THE CITY WELCOMED THE NUMBERS
p287_319 WE HAVE A GOOD HEALTHY DEBATE
p287_320 AND HE GOES WITH IT
p287_322 IT IS A COURT CASE
p287_324 LEADING SHARE PRICES HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN PARIS AND FRANKFURT
p287_344 I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
p287_348 IT IS NOT ALL GOOD NEWS AND RELIEF FOR LABOUR HOWEVER
p287_355 I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE PLUNGE
p287_362 THIS SHOULD INCLUDE PROCEDURES FOR PERSONAL IMPORTS
p287_363 THE IDEA WAS FIRST MOOTED A YEAR AGO
p287_364 THREE YEARS AGO HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
p287_368 HE EXPECTED A CONCLUSION BY NEXT THURSDAY
p287_375 SE IS WELL DOWN THAT ROAD
p287_385 TOMORROW WILL BE A DIFFERENT GAME ENTIRELY
p287_392 FINALLY HE PAID FOR THE MOVIE
p287_394 HE PUT SOME COLOUR INTO SCOTTISH HISTORY
p287_396 IT TOOK ABOUT AN HOUR FOR THE GAS TO CLEAR
p287_399 WHAT DO THEY WANT US TO DO
p287_405 IT'S TOO CLOSE TO CALL
p287_415 I AM ASTONISHED AT ATTACK
p288_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p288_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p288_016 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
p288_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p288_024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
p288_032 WE MUST PROVIDE A LONG-TERM SOLUTION TO TACKLE THIS ATTITUDE
p288_034 IT WAS FIT FOR ROYALTY
p288_038 I WAS SCARED
p288_039 IT IS HARD TO AVOID THE CONCLUSION THAT LESSONS HAVE BEEN LEARNED
p288_043 BUT IT MIGHT HAVE DONE
p288_046 REBUILDING PUBLIC TRANSPORT WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
p288_047 HE HAS ALREADY SUFFERED A GOOD DEAL OF UNWANTED ATTENTION
p288_050 I GUESS I WAS LUCKY THOUGH
p288_053 IT'S VERY ODD
p288_056 THAT'S THE TRUTH
p288_057 THE STORY WAS FIRST REPORTED IN THE SPECTATOR MAGAZINE
p288_062 SCOTLAND HAD GREAT ASSETS
p288_063 EQUITY DECLINED TO COMMENT
p288_073 IT WAS CHAOTIC
p288_078 THIS IS THE WAY THINGS SHOULD BE HANDLED
p288_086 BY THEN HE WAS WALKING ON WATER
p288_088 EVERY TIME I PLAY I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR REACTION
p288_090 IT IS A LIFELINE
p288_092 SCOTLAND WILL HAVE STRONG DEFENCES AS PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
p288_096 IT WAS A GOOD PERFORMANCE
p288_099 IT WAS AN ADVENTURE
p288_105 WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY SURPLUS
p288_106 IT IS SO SAD
p288_107 THEY WERE BEHIND THE WHEEL
p288_108 THE FIRE WAS ABOVE THE HOLE
p288_110 ON THIS SHOWING THEY SHOULD STICK WITH THE LADS
p288_113 IT IS RUBBISH
p288_116 THAT'S ALL RIGHT THEN
p288_121 IT HAS REMOVED A BIT OF GUILT
p288_123 THE PROPOSALS ARE TO BE DEBATED ON MONDAY BY CITY COUNCILLORS
p288_129 WE ARE CURRENTLY CONSULTING WITH A WIDE RANGE OF INTERESTED PARTIES
p288_133 IS THAT TITANIC
p288_139 THE DUTCHMAN WAS IN TIME TO SEE THE BREAKTHROUGH
p288_141 THE WEATHER FORECAST ISN'T GOOD
p288_143 CHARLES GORDON LEADER OF GLASGOW CITY COUNCIL DECLINED TO COMMENT
p288_150 IT WAS SO NEW SO EXCITING
p288_151 I'M JUST ENJOYING EVERY MATCH
p288_154 I WAS IN THE TRAIN STATION OVERNIGHT
p288_160 DOES THAT PUT PRESSURE ON US
p288_171 IT SHOULD BE EASY
p288_177 IT'S A PORTRAIT OF GLASGOW NOT THE PORTRAIT
p288_179 IT'S A JOKE
p288_185 IF THE DIRECTOR IS WITH YOU
p288_187 WE HAVE TO RECOGNISE THAT HE IS AN ELUSIVE CHARACTER
p288_192 IT IS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE STANDARD OF FIRE SAFETY PROVISIONS
p288_195 IS THAT SUCCESS
p288_198 I WOULD THINK ABOUT THE END OF JANUARY THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY
p288_213 HOWEVER DUNDEE DESERVED TO WIN THIS GAME
p288_216 WHO WAS ON THE PANEL
p288_223 IT WAS GOOD FUN
p288_225 I'D NEVER SEEN A PLAY ABOUT ME
p288_226 IT IS PERFECTLY EVIDENT THAT THE TIME FOR AN INQUIRY WILL COME
p288_228 THE BODY FOLLOWS THE MIND
p288_235 ON THE GROUND THE WEST BANK WAS AGAIN THE FOCUS OF VIOLENCE
p288_242 A THOUSAND YEARS AGO THE CHURCH WAS A POWERFUL FORCE IN EUROPE
p288_243 IT IS HARD WON
p288_244 JOCK BROWN IS APPOINTED AS GENERAL MANAGER
p288_248 HE SAID HE WAS IMPRESSED BY THE SET-UP AT CELTIC
p288_249 I WILL NOT ALLOW THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SCOTTISH FISHING INDUSTRY
p288_273 HE IS A CLOSE FRIEND OF GORDON BROWN
p288_275 IN ESSENCE THE TEACHING PROFESSION HAS A CHOICE
p288_279 YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE BOTH SIDES
p288_286 THIS IS A NATIONAL CRISIS
p288_301 ONE WAS A LAWYER
p288_304 VIOLENCE AND THREATENING BEHAVIOUR HAS NO PLACE IN A SCHOOL
p288_318 THEY WANTED THE CLUB TO MAKE MONEY
p288_325 HOWEVER THE GROUPS DENIED THE CLAIMS
p288_336 FINALLY HE PAID FOR THE MOVIE
p288_337 YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH ALL AGE GROUPS
p288_339 IN FACT IT IS DEEPLY UNPLEASANT
p288_351 A REPORT IS THE FIRST STEP IN A CRIMINAL CASE IN INDIA
p288_353 IT'S GOOD TO START WITH JUDITH
p288_355 THE PRESSURE IS ON CELTIC IN THE MAIN
p288_356 IN ADDITION IT WAS IN BREACH OF NATURAL JUSTICE
p288_361 OUR NUMBERS ARE SMALL
p288_387 ONE DAY HE THREW THE BABY AGAINST A WALL
p288_405 QUALITY MEAT SCOTLAND WAS VIGOROUS IN ITS DEFENCE OF THE LABELLING
p288_408 THE VISUAL ARTS COMMITTEE TOOK THIS DECISION IN DECEMBER
p292_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p292_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p292_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p292_024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
p292_036 PR WILL BE JUST ONE OF THEM
p292_037 EVERYTHING IS OBVIOUSLY IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES
p292_041 SHE DOES NOT SEE ANYTHING EVER CHANGING
p292_044 THE IDEA HAS POTENTIAL FOR THE FUTURE
p292_046 THAT WAS NOT DUE TO ME
p292_047 STRUCTURAL CHANGES WERE ALSO REQUIRED
p292_050 WHAT IS THE NEW RELIGION
p292_051 FIVE OFFICERS WERE INJURED
p292_057 ONE WOMAN REFUSED TO SIT DOWN
p292_067 WE TEND TO COME GOOD AT THE END
p292_081 I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE IS DEAD
p292_092 HIS PRESENCE WAS VERY IMPORTANT
p292_093 WE ARE PURSUING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT
p292_103 I HAVE GOT A KNIFE
p292_107 THAT HOWEVER IS THE END OF THE GOOD NEWS
p292_109 IT'S NICE TO BE INVOLVED
p292_112 THEY WERE BACK IN FAVOUR WITH THE SAC
p292_125 BRITAIN HAS NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD
p292_130 I HAD A TRAIN TO CATCH
p292_133 IT WAS EVEN WORSE THAN AT HOME
p292_134 I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF SCOTLAND
p292_137 I STILL THINK HE WILL WIN
p292_144 WE'VE HAD AN ENJOYABLE ADVENTURE
p292_153 OTHER FORCES WERE HOWEVER AT WORK
p292_156 IF ONLY THE ACTING PROFESSION WAS THAT SIMPLE
p292_159 WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HIS NAME
p292_160 THEY HAVE KNOWN THE HARD TIMES
p292_173 I CANNOT SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE IRA
p292_174 THIS IS A VERY HIGH PRICE
p292_175 HE IS THE EXAMPLE FOR ALL OF US
p292_177 CLEARLY WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS VERY CAREFULLY
p292_178 ONLY ONE PERSON CAN CLAIM THE CREDIT
p292_187 IT'S NOT BEFORE TIME
p292_193 HOW CAN THEY GET ONE
p292_195 WE HAD TO WORK HARD FOR IT
p292_197 THIS IS MY HOMELAND
p292_198 YOU SAW THE PAIN HE WAS IN
p292_208 WE'VE GOT BETTER PLAYERS HERE
p292_210 WE ARE BEING REALISTIC ABOUT THE CHALLENGES AHEAD
p292_214 OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD WANT TO LOOK AT THIS
p292_219 WE'RE LOOKING FOR UNITY IN THE COUNCIL
p292_220 THE OBSERVER SAW NO EVIDENCE OF FIGHTING
p292_224 NO MEANS TESTING WILL BE REQUIRED
p292_235 THIS WAS NEVER A SUPPORT GROUP
p292_244 THERE IS GREAT DEMAND FOR HUMAN CLONING
p292_245 THE BALANCE ISN'T THERE AT EMI
p292_250 I HAVE PLAYED WELL THE PAST TWO DAYS
p292_253 HE IS AN EXCELLENT DEFENDER STRONG AND QUICK
p292_256 THIS IS TOO MUCH LIKE SCOTLAND
p292_258 THAT GOES BACK A LONG WAY
p292_265 AS FAR AS SCOTLAND IS CONCERNED HE SHOULD RELAX
p292_284 HE HAS CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER
p292_295 THEY ARE IN GOOD SPIRITS
p292_304 OUR TASK IS TO COMPLETE THE PICTURE
p292_313 THIS MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO THE FAMILIES
p292_317 HE WAS ALWAYS NICE TO ME
p292_321 SPECIAL MEASURES WERE NEEDED
p292_335 THE BEST OPTION IS TO DESTROY THE PLANTS
p292_338 THEY ARE WITH THEIR FATHER
p292_340 THE REVIEW HAS BEEN CONDUCTED FAIRLY
p292_341 THEY WILL RUN IN TANDEM WITH NEW WORK
p292_343 AND RIGHT NOW IT ISN'T THERE
p292_346 THE OVERALL EFFECT IS IMPRESSIVE BUT DISTANCING
p292_347 THE GIRLS ARE READY TO COMPETE
p292_350 WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH CHANGE
p292_355 THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN FOR TWO REASONS
p292_370 AND HOW HE KEPT HIS WORD
p292_376 WE WERE GIVEN A BREAK
p292_383 POLITICS IS A TOUGH GAME
p292_392 IT'S A TRUE STORY
p292_393 JOHN PRESCOTT IS JOHN PRESCOTT AS THE PRIME MINISTER WOULD SAY
p292_396 I'D RATHER HAVE BEEN PLAYING
p292_398 SEVERAL OTHERS WERE ABSENT
p292_399 IT IS SURPRISING TO COME BACK THIS WAY
p292_400 LIFE IS ABOUT PEOPLE AND HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT PEOPLE
p292_403 I KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO WIN
p292_410 I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS FILM
p292_412 THEY WOULD NOT TELL US
p292_419 BUT A SURPRISE IS IN STORE
p293_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p293_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p293_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p293_028 ALL MY TRAINING IS FOR ATHENS
p293_037 I HAVE GOT TO ADOPT THE SAME APPROACH
p293_039 IT'S A SENSIBLE MANAGEMENT DECISION
p293_041 I WOULD JUST LIKE SOMEONE TO CONFESS
p293_047 THAT WAS THE THEORY ANYWAY
p293_053 WE FELT AT THE MOMENT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE
p293_058 THE CABINET IS SPLIT OVER THE ISSUE
p293_059 IN FACT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE SURVIVAL BUSINESS
p293_061 THIS WAS DISMISSED AS ABSOLUTE NONSENSE
p293_063 HE HAD OTHER THINGS ON HIS MIND
p293_066 IT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE
p293_070 I WAS SHAKING ON THE BLOCKS
p293_072 YOU SEE MY BACK HAS GONE
p293_076 MORE THAN HALF OF THE SCHOOL COLLAPSED
p293_077 WE ALSO HOPE TO MEET THE MEN
p293_084 HOWEVER IT'S GOOD TO TURN THE PAGE
p293_086 SELF CONTROL IS JUST ONE INSTALMENT
p293_089 A HARD ACT TO FOLLOW BUT IT IS BEING FOLLOWED
p293_092 I SEEM TO KEEP THIS FOR THE MAJORS
p293_101 COMMITTING SUICIDE IS NOT A CRIMINAL OFFENCE
p293_110 SO IN A SENSE IT WAS A GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY
p293_113 THE COST OF WAR IS MORE THAN THAT
p293_116 PR FOR WESTMINSTER IS THEIR HOLY GRAIL
p293_122 IF THAT IS THE PERCEPTION THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED
p293_127 THE TALIBAN RESPONSE WAS SWIFT
p293_129 IN FACT THEY SHOULD HAVE SCORED THREE TIMES
p293_133 REVIVING THE SCOTTISH OPEN IS ONE OPTION
p293_150 WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CAUSED THE DERAILMENT
p293_155 HOWEVER HIS REMARKS WERE HEAVILY QUALIFIED
p293_156 IT'S SOMETHING HE HAS WORKED VERY HARD ON
p293_158 LAST NIGHT THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE WAS EMERGING
p293_160 THE ONLY ANSWER IS A PUBLIC INQUIRY
p293_179 SADLY TOO MANY OF THEM ARE SIMILAR
p293_183 THE CRUCIAL STRIKE WAS YET TO COME
p293_185 THIS IS THE STUFF OF LIVE MUSIC
p293_188 BUT ALLEN IS DEADLY SERIOUS
p293_190 THE FIRE WAS FALLING FROM THE SKY
p293_196 WE WILL ONLY MOVE FORWARD
p293_210 THE INVESTMENT PROGRAMME WILL DELIVER THESE IMPROVEMENTS
p293_219 HE IS INDEED THE GRANDSON OF TRAVELLING FOLK
p293_225 BILL CLINTON ALWAYS HAD AN IDEA TO SELL
p293_226 THEY HAVE TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION
p293_245 WE LIVE BY THE RULE OF LAW
p293_256 THE PROTEST WILL GO AHEAD AS PLANNED
p293_258 THAT FIGHT BEGINS TODAY FOR FREEDOM AND LIBERTY
p293_263 IT FEELS LIKE A PRIVILEGE
p293_266 HE WILL BE ADVISED BY ME
p293_269 IT'S PART OF YOUR LIFE
p293_276 I KNOW YOU WENT BACK THIS MORNING
p293_282 WE VERY MUCH REGRET THAT IT HAS OCCURRED
p293_285 THEY FEEL IT BELONGS TO THEM
p293_287 THEY CERTAINLY DO NOT SOCIALISE
p293_301 BUT THEY WILL NOT BE COMPELLED TO JOIN
p293_302 IT WILL VOTE WITH THE US
p293_306 AGAIN THE VERDICT WAS NOT PROVEN
p293_313 SUCH ADJUSTMENTS HAVE BEEN THE SALVATION OF UNITED
p293_314 IT IS ALSO CLAIMED THAT HE WAS MURDERED
p293_316 LAST YEAR HOWEVER WAS A DIFFERENT STORY
p293_319 FRANKLY THEY HAVE TO CRACK DOWN
p293_320 ELEVEN EVENTS ARE REQUIRED
p293_321 THE MINISTERS ARE NOW TO MAKE THEIR DECISION
p293_331 HE IS IN CHARGE ON THE PITCH
p293_332 DETECTIVES ARE WAITING TO INTERVIEW THE MEN
p293_336 WELL UNTIL RECENTLY HE DIDN'T THINK SO
p293_344 HE IS DYING FROM CANCER
p293_345 THE PACKAGE HAS BEEN PROPERLY COSTED
p293_348 HE QUIT IN OCTOBER
p293_350 FAMOUSLY THOUGH THERE WAS A CATCH
p293_352 BARRY WILL BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS
p293_355 BUT IT CAN HAPPEN FOR TIGER
p293_363 SHE IS BELIEVED TO BE IN SOUTH AFRICA
p293_367 HOPEFULLY THE GOALS WILL RETURN ON WEDNESDAY
p293_376 IT IS NOT A ROAD OF LIFE
p293_391 I DO NOT BELIEVE THEY ARE
p293_392 THE AIRCRAFT WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED
p293_397 WHAT KIND OF PERSON IS HE
p293_400 AND THIS TOURNAMENT WILL TRAVEL
p294_001 PLEASE CALL STELLA
p294_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p294_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p294_010 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
p294_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p294_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p294_030 HE SAID SHE WAS MAD
p294_031 THEY WERE IMPRESSIVE AGAINST FRANCE
p294_036 MICHAEL HE IS RUNNING
p294_037 HE WAS TAKEN TO HOSPITAL BUT LATER DIED
p294_041 I'VE BEEN DYING FOR AN HOUR
p294_042 IT WASN'T A FLIGHT OF FANCY
p294_046 WHO WAS THE MYSTERY MP
p294_048 I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE FIGHT
p294_056 THIS IS A POSSIBLE WAY FORWARD
p294_057 I AM NOT HERE TO GET EVEN
p294_058 FREEDOM FROM SERBIA IS A GROWING OBJECTIVE
p294_064 IT IS ALL ABOUT HAVING PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
p294_065 PEOPLE REMEMBER THE TORIES IN OFFICE
p294_066 WHAT KIND OF INCLUSION IS THAT
p294_067 I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT RIGHT AWAY
p294_069 IT MAKES FOR AN INTERESTING CONFERENCE
p294_070 I DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWER FOR THEM
p294_074 THIS IS THE REAL THING NOW
p294_078 SUBS NOT USED MCGRAW
p294_086 WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS IMPORTANT
p294_090 HE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM A RUN
p294_093 BUT NOW IT'S BACK TO GOLF
p294_094 IT SHOULD BE A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT
p294_097 IN FACT THEY GO HAND IN HAND
p294_108 THAT'S NOT PART OF THE DEAL
p294_111 WE HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN DEREK
p294_113 I DON'T KNOW THE NATURE OF THE ILLNESS
p294_121 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AFTER
p294_122 DID HE JUST WANT TO BE ON TELLY
p294_123 HE SEEMS TO BE USED TO THE ATTENTION
p294_124 IT'S AN HOUR OF THE SAME RESPONSE
p294_144 IT IS A QUESTION OF LIFE AND DEATH
p294_148 WE ARE ALL VERY PROUD OF HER
p294_151 IT'S LIKE A SCORE IN SOME WAYS
p294_155 YOU FEEL THE PRIDE
p294_159 YOU'VE BEEN WORKING FOR FOUR YEARS
p294_169 I ENJOY MY WORK
p294_170 WE HAVE MANAGED TO GET IT UNDER CONTROL
p294_171 WE HAVE A GENUINE BUDGET IN PLACE
p294_180 MY PLACE IS IN THE KITCHEN
p294_182 A DECISION IS EXPECTED IN SEPTEMBER
p294_205 OUR TRADITIONS AND CULTURES REMAIN THE SAME
p294_208 THIS CLUB IS PERFECT FOR ME
p294_216 WE'RE VERY VERY EXCITED
p294_217 IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF TALKING
p294_221 THE SIX OTHERS WERE INJURED
p294_237 HE WAS OVERWHELMED BY THE RESPONSE
p294_247 EVERYTHING ELSE IS THE SAME
p294_251 MENTAL HEALTH IS A MASSIVE ISSUE
p294_253 WE DON'T WANT TO BE TOO INTRUSIVE
p294_254 THEIR OWN INSTINCTIVE RESPONSE WAS CONFIRMED
p294_260 I HAVEN'T A CLUE
p294_263 A STATEMENT IS EXPECTED IN APRIL
p294_271 I ALSO THOUGHT THIS IS A FEATURE FILM
p294_273 BOY IS THE TOWN A MESS
p294_275 WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE
p294_276 NEITHER OF THEM WAS BADLY HURT
p294_281 I'VE NEVER SEEN THEM DOWN HERE
p294_284 THIS IS OUR CHANCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND
p294_286 IT DIDN'T WORK AGAINST SWEDEN BUT THAT WAS THE INTENTION
p294_292 THIS COULD ALSO AFFECT THE SENTENCING
p294_294 WHAT DO THEY DO ANYWAY
p294_311 THEY HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO
p294_315 THE DOCUMENT IS A STARTING POINT FOR DISCUSSION
p294_323 I WANTED TO DROP OUT
p294_339 WHAT'S IT FOR
p294_340 DOWNING STREET DEFENDED THE SCALE OF THE AWARDS
p294_345 WHERE ARE YOU TAKING HER
p294_350 THERE WERE NO VIOLATIONS
p294_356 SO FAR HE HAS NOT DONE SO
p294_387 HE IS IN THE QUEUE
p294_388 BUT WHAT IS
p294_389 IT WASN'T ABOUT HER SINGING THOUGH
p294_392 MY MIND WAS MADE UP
p294_403 WE WILL DEAL WITH THE REFUGEES
p294_405 IT'S A TRAGEDY FOR THE AREA
p294_409 SUCH IS THE EGO INVOLVED
p294_414 WOULD IT REALLY BE GOOD TO SHORTEN IT
p294_418 OR RATHER IT ISN'T
p295_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION
p295_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p295_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p295_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p295_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p295_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p295_038 THAT MEANS AN EXTRA TWO YEARS
p295_039 I THINK HE WAS NERVOUS TO BEGIN WITH
p295_040 OUR CHILDREN ARE THE FUTURE OF OUR SOCIETY
p295_043 IT'S JUST NOT OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM
p295_051 I THINK IT WAS ENTIRELY THE RIGHT DECISION
p295_053 FOR SURE WE WANT TO WIN IT
p295_057 WE RECORDED IT AT OUR OWN EXPENSE
p295_063 THEY HAVE A CAR AND CANNOT AFFORD ANOTHER
p295_066 I AM A SOLDIER A SOLDIER A SOLDIER
p295_069 SO NOW WE KNOW THE SECRET
p295_095 I HAD SOME TIME WITH ASTON VILLA
p295_101 WE WANT TO BE SEPARATE FROM OUR NEIGHBOURS
p295_107 HE HAD A DIFFERENT AGENDA ENTIRELY
p295_112 IT IS REFORM IN RETURN FOR RESOURCES
p295_117 THE SCOTS ARE HOWEVER IN GOOD COMPANY
p295_120 THE WHOLE THING IN GENERAL IS MOVING ON
p295_122 THEY WERE OUTSTANDING AND THOROUGHLY DESERVED THEIR WIN
p295_123 IF TRUE IT WILL BE THE FIRST SIGN OF DISSENT
p295_126 YOU HAVE A VERY PERSUASIVE PRESIDENT
p295_127 SURE WE HAVE PROBLEMS
p295_129 AXIS ITSELF WAS CREATED FROM THAT EXERCISE
p295_134 I WONDERED ABOUT CHANGING BACK TO RUGBY
p295_141 I GOT VERY VERY TIRED
p295_146 THE JURY IS STILL OUT
p295_147 CLEARLY WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS VERY CAREFULLY
p295_148 AT THE MOMENT THE SUCCESS IN GERMANY IS GOOD
p295_152 WE ARE RIGHT AT THE HEART OF EUROPE
p295_163 EVERYONE IS TAKING A BREATH AND WAITING
p295_170 WE'VE HAD AN ENJOYABLE ADVENTURE
p295_175 ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE THE GOVERNMENT WILL DO
p295_176 IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY MONEY MONEY
p295_178 IT WAS FAR FROM BUSINESS AS USUAL
p295_181 THE PRIME MINISTER WAS INFORMED ON THURSDAY
p295_183 THE DEADLINE IS REAL AND ABSOLUTE
p295_187 HE WAS BORN IN LONDON OF SCOTTISH PARENTS
p295_188 SHE IS STILL VERY POORLY
p295_204 THAT'S WHY HE IS A NATIONAL TREASURE
p295_208 LAST NIGHT THEY WERE BEING COMFORTED BY RELATIVES
p295_211 LEAVING THE LABOUR PARTY IS ONE THING
p295_214 WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS INSTANCE IS SERIOUS MISCONDUCT
p295_221 THIS IS THE BEST MOMENT OF MY CAREER
p295_237 WE HAVE SEEN THE FAILURE OF POLITICS
p295_261 I THINK IT'LL BE A GREAT OCCASION
p295_266 THE BOMBING HAS HAD A HUGE INFLUENCE
p295_268 THIS LATTER POINT IS HUGELY IMPORTANT
p295_273 IN FACT IT WAS ALMOST AS IF IT WAS EXPECTED
p295_275 MY VIEW HAS NOW COMPLETELY CHANGED
p295_280 LOOK AT THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS
p295_287 BUT THE CHAMPIONSHIP IS NOT OVER YET
p295_292 ANYONE CAN STILL WIN THIS TOURNAMENT
p295_298 FERGUSON IS NOT INTERESTED IN THE FINANCES
p295_310 IN ORDER TO GET THERE WE HAVE GOT TO INVEST
p295_312 THE QUALITY OF LIFE IS DIFFICULT FOR THEM
p295_314 BUT HONESTLY THERE IS NO NEED FOR US TO PANIC
p295_318 IT'S AN HOUR OF THE SAME RESPONSE
p295_322 THIS WAS THE PERFORMANCE AND THE RESULT THEY NEEDED
p295_325 WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO MAKING IT IN EUROPE
p295_327 THE DECISION WAS LEFT ENTIRELY TO HIM
p295_333 HIS COMMITMENT ON THE OTHER HAND IS CLEAR
p295_341 THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAVE BEEN REALLY BAD
p295_342 I BELIEVE IN PUBLIC SERVICES
p295_351 ALL INQUIRIES SHOULD BE MADE TO THE POLICE
p295_357 OUR GREAT DEPRESSION IS OUR LIVES
p295_358 HE WAS ELECTED AS A COUNCILLOR LAST YEAR
p295_376 A SPOKESMAN REFUSED TO CONFIRM THE FIGURE
p295_386 THAT HOWEVER IS ONLY PART OF THE STORY
p295_387 IT WORKED WELL IN MONACO
p295_390 WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HIS NAME
p295_392 I HAVE PLAYED REALLY WELL ALL YEAR
p295_395 IT WAS A FIERY GAME
p295_400 HE'S CLOSE FRIEND OF GORDON BROWN
p295_410 TO ME IT WAS JUST A MIRACLE
p295_412 THAT CAN HAPPEN SO EASILY
p295_415 SCOTLAND NEEDS TO HEAR IT TOO
p295_419 EVERYTHING IS SURROUNDED BY CONFUSION
p295_420 BUT OF COURSE IT ISN'T
p295_421 WE ARE ALMOST AT THAT POINT BUT NOT QUITE
p295_423 THE DOCUMENT IS A STARTING POINT FOR DISCUSSION
p297_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY THAT HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p297_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p297_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p297_025 BUT IT'S BEEN KEPT TO A MINIMUM
p297_029 I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT IT
p297_030 TOMMY IS NOT A PROBLEM
p297_033 OTHER FORCES WERE HOWEVER AT WORK
p297_039 HER MOTHER SAID SHE DIDN'T LOOK VERY WELL AT ALL
p297_045 ON THE CONTRARY IT WAS ACTUALLY VERY FUNNY
p297_046 EXCEPT FOR THIS IT WAS OFFSIDE
p297_054 JANUARY IS A BAD TIME OF YEAR
p297_056 THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR ROLE
p297_061 BASICALLY THE CLASSICAL TRADITION WON OUT
p297_067 BIG BROTHER IS LISTENING TO YOU
p297_068 WE WILL BE PAYING AGENCY RATES
p297_069 THIS IS A VERY HIGH PRICE
p297_079 THEN HE DID IT TWICE
p297_091 CRAIG IS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR US
p297_099 THE SCHEME IS HOPELESSLY FAILING
p297_102 IT ISN'T JUST A DEFINING ISSUE FOR THEM
p297_106 AND IF HE HADN'T BECOME A MUSICIAN
p297_124 UNITED WERE IN CONTROL WITHOUT ALWAYS BEING DOMINANT
p297_132 BUT THAT'S NOT THE IDEA BEHIND THIS ARTICLE
p297_135 WORSE STILL HE MIGHT BE SINGING LADY IN RED
p297_138 IT WAS BETTER THAN A SOAP OPERA
p297_147 WE HAD A REALLY GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH DAVID
p297_150 IT IS THE WEALTHIEST IN EUROPE
p297_153 THAT'S MY BIG CHALLENGE
p297_155 THEY SAID WE WERE OUT OF TOUCH
p297_160 TAX IS A MATTER FOR NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS
p297_162 HE ADMITTED THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT
p297_165 DON'T GET ME WRONG
p297_172 I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT HIS CAREER
p297_173 SCOTTISH ATHLETICS IS OPPOSED TO PERMITTING A MOVE
p297_183 I READ IT EVERY YEAR
p297_185 THERE IS NO GUARANTEE
p297_189 NEWS OF THE FUNDING WAS BROADLY WELCOMED YESTERDAY
p297_190 THERE'S NOT MUCH MONEY IN CYCLING
p297_199 ANY ERROR IS SEVERELY PUNISHED
p297_202 WE HAVE A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT
p297_203 THE HOME TEAM ALSO HAD THEIR MOMENTS
p297_209 IT'S A METAPHOR FOR CONSUMPTION
p297_216 SECONDLY THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS FOR PATIENTS
p297_219 I'M LOOKING AT WAYS TO DO THAT NOW
p297_225 IT WAS MORE LIKE A LABOUR PARTY RALLY
p297_232 SHE ADDED THE SHERIFF WAS OBVIOUSLY FRUSTRATED
p297_234 I ENJOYED MY WORK IN THE SCOTTISH OFFICE
p297_241 EVERY GAME AGAINST NEW ZEALAND IS
p297_242 DIALOGUE IS THE KEY
p297_254 WHO DID THE RECRUITING
p297_255 MR STRAW WAS HOME SECRETARY AT THE TIME
p297_262 WITH US WE JUST WANT THEM TO RESPOND
p297_268 GOVERNMENT MUST RECOGNISE THE PROBLEMS OF ABERDEEN
p297_271 WHO REMINDED HIM ABOUT THE SCORE
p297_274 MIND YOU HE HASN'T BEEN BACK FOR AGES
p297_275 HOW DO YOU FIND THE YOUNGSTERS
p297_276 THEY ARE DECLINING ELSEWHERE IN THE UK
p297_277 IT DOES NOT MOVE WHICH IS AMAZING
p297_282 MR FORRESTER REACTED ANGRILY
p297_283 THIS IS WRONG BUT THAT'S BELIEVED
p297_286 THE WHOLE MATTER IS SOMEWHAT IN THE AIR
p297_297 HE PLANNED TO RELOCATE TO SCOTLAND PROBABLY EDINBURGH
p297_309 THEY WILL GIVE IT A COUPLE OF YEARS
p297_317 HE CONFIRMED THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO WARNING
p297_319 THE COMPANY'S IN GOOD SHAPE
p297_336 IT'S AN INTERESTING TITLE BELIEVING IN BRITAIN
p297_337 YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE AWAY MY LIFE
p297_346 IT WAS BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION
p297_349 IT WAS ALL TOO LITTLE TOO LATE
p297_351 LAST NIGHT SHE REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THE ACCIDENT
p297_353 THE PROFESSOR SAID THE RESULTS WERE POSITIVE
p297_358 HE SAID HE HAD NO REPORTS OF CASUALTIES
p297_359 IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY
p297_372 EQUALLY HE IS GRATEFUL TO HAVE SURVIVED THE CULL
p297_374 I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR A YEAR
p297_379 EVERYONE HAS HIS SHARE OF TROUBLE
p297_380 YOU NEED A LICENCE TO RUN A PUB
p297_387 SMALLER PARTIES HAVE REASON TO BE PLEASED
p297_395 IT WAS TO BE PUBLISHED NEXT MONTH
p297_402 I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH GETTING OLDER
p297_404 I PLAYED REALLY WELL ON THE BACK NINE
p297_416 HOWEVER THIS SUGGESTION WAS TURNED DOWN BY THE PLAYER
p297_418 NOW HE IS TRYING TO DOWNGRADE THE MEDIA
p297_423 THERE WAS A SUBSTANTIAL EXPLOSION
p298_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p298_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p298_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p298_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p298_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p298_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p298_033 I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE RESPECT
p298_040 I LET GO THE TELEPHONE AND RAN
p298_044 I WILL NOT BE IN DIALOGUE WITH HER
p298_052 WHO SAID IMPATIENCE IS A VIRTUE
p298_053 JIM WALLACE JUSTICE MINISTER HAS REFUSED TO HOLD AN INQUIRY
p298_056 SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE ATTENDED YESTERDAY
p298_062 DON'T SAY YOU HAVE NOT BEEN WARNED
p298_066 WHO THEN IS GOING TO BE CAPTAIN OF EUROPE
p298_081 IT IS IN OTHER WORDS ENTRAPMENT BY ANOTHER NAME
p298_095 THE PREMIER LEAGUE HAS BEEN A HUGE SUCCESS
p298_098 SHE IS ON A LIFE SUPPORT MACHINE
p298_107 URGENT ACTION IS NEEDED TO TACKLE THIS CRISIS
p298_119 COUNCIL OFFICIALS ARE INVOLVED ALONG WITH THE TRANSPORT INDUSTRY
p298_120 AFTER ABOUT A YEAR THE FEELING RETURNED TO MY FINGER
p298_121 THEY WILL KNOW THEY DESERVE TO BE THERE
p298_128 A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE IN TEARS
p298_129 WE HAVE GREAT TEAM SPIRIT
p298_132 THEY SHOULD TAKE THEIR MOBILE PHONES
p298_133 HE LOVED HIS JOB AND WORKING IN NEWSPAPERS
p298_135 I FIRST MET HIM LAST SUMMER
p298_136 IT WAS TO BE PUBLISHED NEXT MONTH
p298_142 IT WAS TOUGH BUT WE DID HAVE A LOT OF POSSESSION
p298_144 THAT END IS ENJOYING LIFE AS FAR AS DAVID IS CONCERNED
p298_152 WHO WOULD TAKE IT NOW AFTER ALL THIS
p298_153 I FELT REALLY GOOD UNTIL FRIDAY
p298_157 THERE IS PRECIOUS LITTLE MIDDLE GROUND
p298_158 SHE WAS SHOUTING MY BABY MY BABY
p298_159 THE INQUIRY HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR MONTHS
p298_166 HILLARY PLANS TO MEET HIM ON THE SUMMIT

p298_335 LAST YEAR IT WAS LIGAMENTS IN HIS KNEE
p298_337 SENTENCE WAS DEFERRED FOR BACKGROUND REPORTS
p298_343 A QUALITY AUDIT OFFICER HAS ALSO BEEN APPOINTED
p298_344 OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE IS NOT DOING THEIR JOB PROPERLY
p298_354 HE SAW IT ALL AS A BIG GAME
p298_355 THE BOY IS NO LONGER WITH US
p298_364 I'M LOOKING AT WAYS TO DO THAT NOW
p298_375 IT'S GOOD NEWS AND LONG OVERDUE
p298_378 HE HAS BEEN CAMPAIGNING FOR CHANGE FOR YEARS

p299_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p299_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p299_028 GILBERT WAS NOT AMUSED
p299_031 IT HAS MOVED ON IN THE LAST WEEK
p299_039 I THINK WE HAVE A VERY STRONG CASE
p299_043 I'VE LEARNED FROM MY MISTAKES
p299_054 I HAVE BEEN HERE FOR ONLY THREE MONTHS
p299_056 I THINK IT IS A SENSIBLE CHANGE
p299_057 SEX IS FUN
p299_071 BOTH OF THOSE PROMISES HAVE ALREADY BEEN HONOURED
p299_076 WE'VE ALWAYS HAD THREE OPTIONS AND NONE OF THEM ARE PERFECT
p299_086 DEBATE WAS IMPASSIONED AND FURIOUS
p299_087 WE ARE LOSING THIS WAR
p299_090 FOR ONE VETERAN THE MEMORIES REMAIN VIVID
p299_099 IT WAS A BIT OF A STRUGGLE TODAY
p299_103 HE HAD A HEART PROBLEM
p299_106 THAT WAS THE LIGHT RELIEF
p299_108 HE HAS ONE SON AND ONE DAUGHTER
p299_117 IT FELT LIKE MY SUPPORT SYSTEM WAS LEAVING
p299_119 I AM HAPPY WITH MY FORM

p299_148 THESE MATTERS ARE NOW BEHIND US
p299_150 THOUSANDS OF HOMES WERE LEFT WITHOUT POWER SUPPLIES
p299_158 BUT WE ARE SEVERELY LIMITED IN FUNDS
p299_159 IN SOME CASES THE NATION SHOULD BE GRATEFUL
p299_161 MY HOUSE WAS SHAKING AT THE TIME
p299_162 THEY WILL KNOW THEY DESERVE TO BE THERE
p299_171 WAS IT A FOUL
p299_175 PROMISES WERE NOT KEPT
p299_176 MY LIFE HAS BEEN DESTROYED
p299_180 IT'S NOT IN MY NATURE
p299_182 WHO IS HE
p299_184 OUR MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR FUTURES
p299_199 I'M NOT AFRAID OF THAT
p299_206 THE BUDGET WAS TOO LOW FOR THAT
p299_209 ON THAT THEY AGREE
p299_211 THE OUTCOME IS NOW IN OUR OWN HANDS
p299_217 HE MADE SO MANY BAD DECISIONS
p299_228 THIS MUST BE REALLY SHORT OF IDEAS
p299_229 I THINK HE HAS UNDERGONE A SEA CHANGE
p299_233 I THINK HOWEVER HE WAS HAVING A FIT
p299_241 EVEN FOR A BRITISH OPEN THIS IS DIFFERENT
p299_242 I WAS THE ONLY ONE ARGUING DIFFERENTLY
p299_245 MIND YOU WHO WOULDN'T
p299_255 BEFORE HE LEFT THE SKIPPER SAID THE CREW WERE BRILLIANT
p299_258 I'M JUST DOING ARTWORK
p299_260 I DON'T WANT TO USE THE TERM
p299_264 SO THERE'S A DOUBLE WHAMMY
p299_266 THEIR THREE OTHER CHILDREN HAD DIED AS INFANTS
p299_280 WE NEED TO BE LOOKING TO THE FUTURE
p299_283 SOME OF THE PLAYERS HAVE NOT PROGRESSED
p299_299 LAST MONTH HE MADE HIS DEBUT IN JAPAN
p299_302 THEY WERE THE BETTER SIDE ON THE DAY
p299_303 NO DECISION ON THAT WAS TAKEN
p299_309 I THOUGHT HE WAS PART OF THE CAMERA
p299_319 IT WAS CHAOTIC AND FRIGHTENING
p299_320 I THINK IN THREE DIMENSIONS
p299_322 SOON THE WHOLE COUNTRY WILL BE LEVEL
p299_327 WE COULD NOT HAVE ASKED FOR ANY MORE
p299_330 IT IS THE LOGICAL EXTENSION OF AUDIO DESCRIPTION
p299_333 I HAVE A BUNCH OF VETERANS

p299_339 BARRY WILL BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS
p299_341 WE JUST NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO ACT
p299_342 THE URGENCY IS REAL
p299_354 DO YOU MEAN TODAY
p299_359 YET HE LEFT A FEW DAYS LATER
p299_363 BOTH PARTIES CAN WIN AND SCOTLAND CAN WIN AS A RESULT
p299_376 WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER FOR SOME YEARS
p299_377 CHRIS PATERSON IS A CLASS ACT
p299_378 HE HAS NEVER EVEN BEEN TO IRELAND
p299_387 MARY IS AS IT WERE THE CAUSE OF HER MOTHER'S DEATH
p299_393 WE WELCOME THE PROPOSALS BUT THEY MUST GET ON WITH IT
p299_397 JACK MCCONNELL IS THE OBVIOUS CHOICE
p300_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
p300_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p300_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p300_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p300_035 SOMEONE CAME DOWN AND SAID CAN YOU READ A SCRIPT
p300_039 A FURTHER POLICE INQUIRY IS CURRENTLY BEING HELD
p300_044 WE LIKE BEING THE UNDERDOGS
p300_045 THEY SAID CONSTRUCTION WORK COULD BEGIN WITHIN WEEKS
p300_056 IT COMES ON LIKE A TIDAL WAVE
p300_057 ENGLAND AND WALES ARE LIKELY TO PULL OUT
p300_062 THIS HE TOLD THE COMMITTEE WAS NOT FORTHCOMING
p300_066 HE ALSO DOES NOT GET ALONG WITH CHRISTINA
p300_075 SHE OPENS TONIGHT IN GLASGOW AT THE KING'S THEATRE
p300_076 HENMAN IS TAKING NOTHING FOR GRANTED
p300_077 YOU'D THINK THERE WAS A MATCH ON TODAY
p300_084 WHY DID THEY LET HIM GO
p300_085 ANOTHER SUGGESTION WAS DISMISSED BY VIRGIN
p300_091 HE THEN HAD A SWIPE AT HEARTS
p300_092 ACCORDING TO THE CRITERIA HE IS QUALIFIED FOR SCOTLAND
p300_094 YOU HAD BETTER BELIEVE IT
p300_097 IT'S NOT A NEW CONCEPT IN JAZZ
p300_101 THEREAFTER HE SET HIS MIND ON BECOMING A DOCTOR
p300_103 HOUSING IS IN VERY SHORT SUPPLY
p300_104 AFTER ALL HE IS THE KING OF SCOTLAND
p300_118 FEW OTHER SERVICES IN SCOTLAND ARE AFFECTED THE SPOKESMAN SAID
p300_125 WALLACE WAS A PRISONER OF WAR
p300_126 THERE IS A LACK OF CHEMISTRY
p300_129 DOES A FIREFIGHTER HAVE TO BE KILLED
p300_133 WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY CONSIDERED IT DOWN HERE
p300_136 ALL OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH THEM
p300_155 YOU'VE SEEN THE POLLS THEN SEAN
p300_161 YOU SHOULD BE THERE WITH SIX DIFFERENT CHARACTERS
p300_166 RUNNING COSTS ARE NOT SUBSIDISED BY PUBLIC MONEY
p300_169 WHO DO THESE PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE
p300_172 IT WAS HORRIBLE THAT MUSICAL APARTHEID
p300_179 I CAME HOME BY AMBULANCE
p300_181 THIS WAS EXTREMELY FOOLISH BEHAVIOUR ON YOUR PART
p300_185 I AM WRITING A NOVEL
p300_187 ALL WERE PAID BY THE TAXPAYER
p300_195 I WOULD LIKE GLASGOW
p300_200 IT WAS A MISERABLE AFTERNOON IN FIFE
p300_201 THE TALKING IS GOING ON BUT THE IRAQI PEOPLE WILL SURVIVE
p300_205 WE PLAYED THEM OFF THE PITCH
p300_210 THE NEXT TIME HE SAW HER SHE WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON
p300_212 HE WAS TOO GOOD FOR ME - TOO CONSISTENT
p300_213 IT IS LIKE BEING A QUALIFIER AGAIN
p300_217 I TOLD YOU YOU WERE DOING IT ALL WRONG
p300_228 THEY MAY YET HAVE THE LAST LAUGH
p300_229 YOU CAN FEEL AT HOME IN CHINA
p300_231 WE HAVE TRIED TO KEEP HIS HEAD UP
p300_241 THE PROPERTY IS OWNED BY GLASGOW CITY COUNCIL
p300_242 THEY WERE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES
p300_253 A MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT HOWEVER WAS CONCEDED
p300_254 PEOPLE WOULD SAY HE THINKS HE CAN DO THAT AS WELL
p300_267 AFTER DAY ONE BACK HE MAY BE REVISING THAT OPINION ALREADY
p300_268 ONCE THEY GO AWAY THEY WON'T COME BACK
p300_269 THE BEST MARRIAGES ARE MADE IN HEAVEN
p300_270 THE MAIN THING IS THAT THEY ENJOY IT
p300_287 THEY DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER BUT THEY HAVE MADE THIS COMMITMENT
p300_289 THE FUND HAS THREE ELEMENTS
p300_291 IT'S NOT EVEN FINISHED
p300_316 I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR A YEAR
p300_317 I ENJOY PLAYING WITH BOTH OF THEM
p300_331 HOWEVER WITHIN FIVE MINUTES THEY WERE ABLE TO CELEBRATE
p300_332 HE MADE NO BIG MISTAKES
p300_348 IT IS A SIMPLE EQUATION
p300_359 IT'S A LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE FORMULA
p300_361 NATO HAS COMPLETED PLANNING FOR AIR STRIKES
p300_365 BOTH ARE NATIONAL TREASURES
p300_375 WE WERE VERY HAPPY WITH OUR RESULTS WHICH WERE EXCELLENT
p300_379 THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME MEASURE OF PROTECTION
p300_380 THEY DID NOT THREATEN ANYONE
p300_381 WHO IS GOING TO PAY THEIR WAGES
p300_384 BUT THIS IS NOT JUST A TIBETAN ISSUE
p300_385 THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT COUNTS
p300_386 CONSTRUCTION WOULD THEN BEGIN
p300_387 MRS THATCHER WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME
p300_391 FORM AND STRUCTURE ARE HIS MUSIC
p300_392 I DON'T HAVE ANY BITTERNESS ABOUT IT IT'S JUST A FACT
p300_395 VICTORY SHE INSISTED YESTERDAY WAS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE REWARDS
p301_001 PLEASE CALL STELLA
p301_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p301_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION
p301_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p301_024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
p301_025 BUT IT WAS A GREAT DECISION HE JOKED
p301_027 YOU NEED A LONG-TERM STRATEGY IN FOOTBALL
p301_028 THE LAW HAS GOT TO BE UPHELD
p301_036 JACQUES CHIRAC THE FRENCH PRESIDENT WAS SURELY IN HIS SIGHTS
p301_038 THAT RESPECT IS MISSING IN THE NETHERLANDS
p301_039 THERE'S ALWAYS A SOLUTION SOMEWHERE YOU CAN MEET IN THE MIDDLE
p301_048 I TRY NOT TO EXPECT ANYTHING
p301_052 SHE IS NOW PLANNING A VISIT
p301_054 HERE HE IS IN EFFECT APPOINTING HIMSELF A JUDGE
p301_058 THE ENCOUNTER WAS TO CHANGE HIS LIFE
p301_064 WE TRIED EVERYTHING BUT IT JUST WASN'T TO BE TODAY
p301_070 WHEN HE TOOK OVER IT REALLY TOOK OFF
p301_078 HE ACCUSED THE PRIME MINISTER OF DITHERING
p301_081 HE CAME IN AN ARMY UNIFORM
p301_083 CARS ARE GREAT FOR GOING LONG DISTANCES
p301_086 THE GENERAL SECRETARY REPRESENTS A NEW ERA IN LABOUR PARTY POLITICS
p301_102 I AM SURE ALL SCHOOLS WOULD ACCEPT THAT
p301_104 I NEEDED A CHANGE A NEW CHALLENGE
p301_107 THE LITTLE BOY WAS PLAYING FOOTBALL AT LUNCHTIME
p301_108 INDUSTRY LEADERS REACTED ANGRILY
p301_118 SERB FORCES THEN OPENED FIRE IN THEIR DIRECTION
p301_122 ONE THE ACUTE SERVICES TRUST WILL RUN THE GENERAL HOSPITAL SERVICES
p301_128 HE WAS JUST AWESOME
p301_129 WE NOW HAVE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE LEAGUE
p301_140 FLORIDA IS THE PIVOTAL STATE IN THE NATION
p301_141 VOLVO IS GRATEFUL TO ITS STAFF IN IRVINE
p301_149 WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT WILL MAKE CLEAR
p301_156 BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS
p301_161 THERE IS NO CREDIBLE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT
p301_162 I UNDERSTAND THE MEDICAL CONCERNS
p301_165 I AM AWARE THAT SOMEBODY MADE A THREAT
p301_174 WHAT THEN IS THE REAL THING
p301_176 THAT WILL BE THE SWEETNESS
p301_178 THE BIG ISSUE FOR US IS THE REVIEW
p301_185 YOU CAN SAY HE GETS A SIZEABLE AMOUNT
p301_191 WE ARE SEEKING FUNDS FROM GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
p301_199 FRANKLY IT WAS WORTH THE BOOKING
p301_211 BUT HE JUST CARRIED ON ANYWAY
p301_216 THERE ARE SCHOOLBOYS IN UNIFORM
p301_224 IT HAD A GIGANTIC EFFECT
p301_225 I LIKE MANY OTHERS WILL CONSIDER WHERE WE GO FROM HERE
p301_227 THE TEAM THIS YEAR IS GOING PLACES
p301_229 IT TOOK MORE THAN TWO YEARS
p301_232 THAT'S THE KEY ISSUE ISN'T IT
p301_233 ITS WORKFORCE IS TO BE MADE REDUNDANT
p301_252 FOR SURE YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU ASK HIM
p301_253 JOHN ANDERSON THE FORMER SCOTTISH NATIONAL COACH IS STILL UNEARTHING TALENT
p301_258 BUT THEY CANNOT GO ON IGNORING THE TRUTH
p301_262 SCOTLAND HAS BEEN CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE
p301_270 IT IS BELIEVED SHE HAD SERIOUS HEAD INJURIES
p301_272 DRINK AND PETROL PRICES REMAIN UNTOUCHED
p301_274 THE PILOT WAS MAKING A VISUAL APPROACH
p301_297 THEY ARE THE INNOCENT VICTIMS
p301_310 OF FURTHER PRIVACY HE HAD NO NEED
p301_317 I LOOK FOR DANCERS WHO ARE ALSO ACTORS
p301_323 NOT THAT AGASSI WAS A BELIEVER
p301_325 TOURISM IS A VITAL INDUSTRY FOR SCOTLAND
p301_329 I PLAYED WELL ON SATURDAY AND AGAIN TODAY
p301_333 THEY'VE BEEN AT IT FOR FIVE HOURS
p301_334 THERE IS NO ANSWER TO IT
p301_336 BIRTHDAYS ARE WONDERFUL AND TERRIBLE THINGS
p301_337 HIS ENGLISH COUNTERPART AGREED
p301_339 HE WASN'T REALLY DOING ANYTHING SO HE WANTED OUT
p301_351 HE KNEW IT WOULD COST HIM MILLIONS
p301_353 SADLY THE REVIVAL COULD NOT BE SUSTAINED
p301_355 THAT ONLY CAME OUT DURING A RADIO INTERVIEW
p301_357 THEY WERE THE BEST TEAM BUT UNLUCKY IN THE END
p301_362 HE WILL ADDRESS THE NATION THIS EVENING
p301_363 THEY HAVE SHOWN A GREAT DESIRE AND ATTITUDE
p301_368 IF THEY HAVE CITY BACKING WHAT IS THE INFLUENCE
p301_369 MOVING FROM MANCHESTER TO LONDON WAS UPHEAVAL ENOUGH
p301_370 MR STRAW WAS HOME SECRETARY AT THE TIME
p301_382 FILTERING THROUGH THIS MATERIAL A COMPOSITE FINALLY EMERGES
p301_387 THEY WANT TO AVOID A FLASHPOINT
p301_393 MCMASTER HAD ALREADY SEEN THE FIRST PART
p301_394 IT'S ABOUT MY TIME AS A GUITARIST
p301_407 MY THOUGHTS ARE WITH THEIR FAMILIES
p301_411 STILL THE EXPERIENCE WAS AMAZING SHE SAYS
p302_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p302_004 WE ALSO NEED A SMALL PLASTIC SNAKE AND A BIG TOY FROG FOR THE KIDS
p302_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p302_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p302_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF A SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p302_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN YELLOW LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p302_028 ALRIGHT IT WAS A DEFEAT BUT IT FELT LIKE A VICTORY
p302_031 IT HAS BEEN BLOWN OUT OF ALL PROPORTION
p302_034 MY GAME IS IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE
p302_035 HOW COME IT IS SO OFTEN UNNOTICED
p302_039 ALL OF US DO
p302_043 THEATRE IS NOT A MUSEUM
p302_050 I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T
p302_065 IT IS JUST PART OF MODERN DAY LIFE
p302_066 A YOUNG BRITON HAD A LUCKY ESCAPE
p302_070 BUT IT WAS TO NO AVAIL
p302_075 HE NOW LIVES IN EDINBURGH WITH HIS WIFE CAROLINE
p302_089 IT'S A FLOURISHING AND BEAUTIFUL CITY
p302_093 THAT WAS A HARD GAME TO PLAY IN VERY TOUGH
p302_094 THE BOAT WAS FULLY EQUIPPED WITH SAFETY EQUIPMENT
p302_095 THERE WAS AN ELEMENT OF JEALOUSY
p302_097 EDINBURGH IN FACT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SURVEY
p302_102 DOES IT FEEL LIKE THE IDEAS AND EMOTIONS
p302_105 IT SEPARATES THE MEN FROM THE BOYS
p302_114 IT IS TIME FOR A MORE HONEST APPROACH
p302_115 THE MOVE IS CONSIDERED A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH
p302_116 I CAN ASSURE YOU THE NEW AUGUSTA NATIONAL IS EXACTLY THAT
p302_125 WE ARE STILL GETTING SIGNALS
p302_129 THE NEW DEAL WILL CONSTANTLY BE IMPROVED
p302_131 I HEARD SOME OF HIS REMARKS
p302_135 THE EUROPEAN COURT IS OUR ONLY OPTION
p302_141 THE WHOLE REGION IS IN SHOCK
p302_143 LORD LEVY SAID HE'D STARTED HIS LIFE WITH NOTHING
p302_144 YOU WERE THE KIDNAPPERS
p302_147 I COULD FEEL THE BLOOD ON MY FACE
p302_148 THE REAL IRA WAS BLAMED FOR THE BLAST
p302_163 ALTHOUGH IT WAS EXPECTED EVERYONE IS VERY VERY ANGRY
p302_166 I WAS DOING WELL AT THE HUSTINGS
p302_170 BUT SHE'S ALSO BEAUTIFUL BEHIND THE FACE
p302_172 AND NOW HE TELLS US
p302_173 NOW THOUGH HE IS BACK PLAYING SUPERBLY FOR BLACKBURN
p302_182 BY SOCIAL DEVICES THE TWO GROUPS ARE COMING TOGETHER
p302_190 THERE WAS GREAT SUPPORT ALL ROUND THE ROUTE
p302_193 SCOTTISH FISHERMEN COMENDED THE DECISION
p302_198 THIS MUST BE KEPT IN TOTAL PERSPECTIVE
p302_202 I'VE NEVER BEEN LIMITED ON DRUGS
p302_203 THEY COULD TAKE THE RESULT AWAY FROM THEM COULDN'T THEY
p302_207 WHY SHOULD WE EVEN BE ASKED TO SHARE
p302_210 I WAS SURPRISED BY HIS RESPONSE
p302_231 THERE IS NO REASON AT ALL
p302_233 THERE IS A TUNNEL AFTER THE TUNNEL
p302_237 I HAD A SENSE OF DEJA VU
p302_239 THEY FOLLOW HIM EVERYWHERE
p302_240 I COULDN'T MAKE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON
p302_244 I'M BACK PLAYING FOOTBALL WHICH IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
p302_253 EVERYTHING HAPPENED SO QUICKLY THAT WE WERE TAKEN BY SURPRISE
p302_261 HE ALSO RECEIVED A MEDAL OF HONOUR
p302_271 INCLUSION AND AUTISM IS IT WORKING
p302_275 THAT GOT ME OUT OF JAIL
p302_276 WE HAVE TURNED THE CORNER
p302_296 I'VE GOT A YOUNG FAMILY
p302_300 THE FRUSTRATION WAS SHOWING
p302_312 HOWEVER THERE WAS NO HOPE AND GLORY TOO FOR SCOTLAND
p303_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p303_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p303_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p303_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p303_017 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
p303_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p303_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p303_026 THERE WILL BE WIDESPREAD SUPPORT ON ALL SIDES
p303_034 THE CRACKDOWN IS LAUNCHED TODAY BY THE GOVERNMENT
p303_039 WE GAVE EVERYTHING WE HAD
p303_040 I LET GO THE TELEPHONE AND RAN
p303_042 HIS CHARISMA IS ALL ON THE COURSE
p303_044 I WILL NOT BE IN DIALOGUE WITH HER
p303_067 MOST PEOPLE KNOW THAT
p303_068 SOME PEOPLE STILL THINK SHE SHOULD BE ENGLISH
p303_071 THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH WAS UNCLEAR
p303_072 WHAT DO THEY PAY TO JOIN THE CLUB
p303_073 TWO PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO SHARE THE DUTY
p303_077 HE WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY GENUINE
p303_082 DISRUPTION WILL BE KEPT TO A MINIMUM
p303_085 WE REALLY NEED RESEARCH TO HELP WITH THAT
p303_096 THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS WAS ALSO HIS IDEA
p303_110 THERE WAS NO TIME SCALE
p303_116 LATELY THAT MARKET HAS COME UNDER PRESSURE
p303_117 AND IT'S MORE SUBVERSIVE
p303_122 I'VE GOT NO SECRET
p303_125 I ASKED WHY HE HAD COME
p303_133 HE LOVED HIS JOB AND WORKING IN NEWSPAPERS
p303_134 WE HAVE BIG IDEAS
p303_141 IT'S A BIT LIKE A BEREAVEMENT
p303_152 WHO WOULD TAKE IT NOW AFTER ALL THIS
p303_153 I FELT REALLY GOOD UNTIL FRIDAY
p303_154 THAT GIVES US SOMETHING TO KICK AGAINST
p303_157 THERE IS PRECIOUS LITTLE MIDDLE GROUND
p303_167 WHAT THEY MAYBE HAVE THREE SCOTTISH PLAYERS
p303_182 THEY JUST WOULD NOT HAVE RUN AWAY
p303_189 IT IS SIMPLE AND EASY TO USE
p303_194 WE KNOW THEM AS MOBILE TELEPHONES
p303_195 MEANWHILE THE ACTION IS SPREADING TO EASTERN EUROPE
p303_197 THEY WERE VERY VERY ANXIOUS AND NERVOUS ABOUT THEIR PERSONAL SAFETY
p303_207 THE LINE-UP IS A TASTY ONE
p303_225 IT DID MY IMAGE A LOT OF GOOD
p303_228 THAT WILL BRING ABOUT A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT
p303_231 I FELL IN LOVE WITH BALLET
p303_243 HOW CAN THEY ENGAGE WITH THE WORK
p303_244 ALL WERE LATER ALLOWED HOME
p303_251 WE'RE TRYING TO LESSEN THE STIGMA
p303_253 BOTH WILL BE HEARD AT GLASGOW SHERIFF COURT
p303_256 PARTLY BUT ONLY PARTLY THIS IS THEIR OWN FAULT
p303_257 THEY SEEM TO BE BACKING OFF FROM THAT
p303_261 THINGS WERE NOT EASY FROM THE OUTSET
p303_266 THERE IS NO SUCH THING
p303_269 AFTER THAT NOTHING COULD SAVE HIM
p303_270 HIS TREATMENT HAS BEEN QUITE ATROCIOUS
p303_275 THERE ARE LOTS OF THESE WOMEN IN FINLAND
p303_276 DRUGS AND HOUSEBREAKING ARE LINKED
p303_279 I BOUGHT A CAR AT AUCTION
p303_289 MR BLAIR WAS IN WASHINGTON A WEEK LATER
p303_302 THAT LEFT A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH
p303_303 BUT EVEN SO YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TRY SOMETHING NEW
p303_312 WE HAVE THE LOCATION WHICH IS ASSURED
p303_314 WHAT IF THE CONFESSION IS AFTER ALL A FAKE
p303_326 WHAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT THE COW
p303_329 I FEEL SORRY FOR THE REDS
p303_337 SENTENCE WAS DEFERRED FOR BACKGROUND REPORTS
p303_338 I'M VERY SAD AND DEEPLY SHOCKED
p303_339 SOME OF HIS FAMILY STILL LIVE THERE
p303_340 HOWEVER THEY CONTINUED IN THEIR PURSUIT OF VICTORY
p303_342 I GET TO WORK WITH VERY GOOD PEOPLE
p303_346 I CAN'T BLAME THE FANS FOR GETTING FRUSTRATED
p303_348 I CAN APPEAR TO BE NICE AND LOVELY
p304_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION
p304_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p304_016 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
p304_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p304_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p304_025 SO WE WILL CUT THEIR NUMBERS
p304_030 THE LIKELIHOOD IS THAT IT WILL BE NEGATIVE
p304_036 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS TO WIN TODAY
p304_037 WE HAVE A STRONG TEAM AT THE MOMENT
p304_041 HOWEVER THEY WILL ONLY BE FOUND IN THE WILD
p304_042 IT WAS AN AMBUSH
p304_043 FOR THESE PEOPLE THE RULING IS VERY WELCOME
p304_045 I WAS DOING A CHARITY CONCERT
p304_046 YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOUR
p304_048 WE ARE WAITING FOR ADVICE ON THE FILM
p304_049 I HADN'T BEEN LOOKING AFTER MYSELF
p304_050 HIS FATHER SAID MY SON WAS LUCKY
p304_059 FOR A MOMENT IT WAS ALL ABOUT HER
p304_060 SADLY THE GAME WILL NEVER SEE HIS LIKE AGAIN
p304_064 MRS ANDERSON SAID THIS ONE WAS DIFFERENT
p304_071 I DO NOT BELIEVE THEY ARE
p304_072 THAT IS COMPLETELY AGAINST ISLAM
p304_079 COULD IT BE
p304_082 WE'RE ALL INVOLVED IN DECIDING WHERE IT GOES
p304_086 I HAVE A THEORY
p304_093 BUT WE ARE LOSING THAT CONNECTION
p304_106 JIM WALLACE HAS BEEN RUNNING THE GOVERNMENT
p304_107 OUR CHILDREN ARE THE FUTURE OF OUR SOCIETY
p304_121 IT'S SOMETHING HE WORKS HARD AT ACHIEVING
p304_123 IT WAS A PRIVILEGE TO WORK FOR HIM
p304_137 BROADCASTING WILL BE TOP OF THE AGENDA
p304_140 AND YET HIS LEGACY IS DOUBTFUL
p304_146 THIS IS A TOTAL MYSTERY
p304_148 DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM
p304_149 SO WHAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL
p304_159 THIS IS NOT A SCOTTISH PROBLEM
p304_160 THEY DO NOT WORK FOR GLASGOW CITY COUNCIL
p304_166 WHAT HAS CHANGED
p304_172 WELL IT HAD TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S FOR SURE
p304_183 THIS IS IT FINALLY FINISHED
p304_199 THAT WOULD BE UNLAWFUL
p304_201 THE SAME GOES FOR MCKENNA
p304_203 THEY WILL WANT TO PERFORM WELL
p304_205 OWNERSHIP WAS THE GAME
p304_207 I LOVE THE MOMENT OF BEING FIRST
p304_209 YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT UNTIL YOU EXPERIENCE IT
p304_210 ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE THE GOVERNMENT WILL DO
p304_226 I NEVER AGREED WITH THAT
p304_228 I DON'T THINK IT IS VITAL
p304_229 BUT HE INSISTED THAT VICTORY WAS POSSIBLE
p304_249 THE BAND WAS GOOD AND IT'S BEEN A GREAT DAY
p304_251 THEY HAVE THE CASH TO DO THAT
p304_255 IT IS A GREAT SHAME
p304_262 I BELIEVE THAT SCOTLAND HAS MUCH TO GAIN
p304_264 HAD SHE ENJOYED THE EXPERIENCE
p304_269 I NEEDED A LITTLE MAN IN THE CROWD
p304_271 ARE WE GOING TO STAY UP
p304_272 PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY NOT ON HIS SIDE
p304_275 IT USED TO BE LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES
p304_288 I LOST MY HEAD
p304_295 BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN FOR HER
p304_301 I CAN'T STAND THIS SORT OF STUFF
p304_309 AS IN BATTLE THE WORST THING IS WAITING FOR IT
p304_313 IT ADDED TO THE REVERENCE
p304_318 I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT
p304_325 I HOPE HE HAS LEARNED FROM IT
p304_330 THE MATTER WILL COME UP AGAIN
p304_337 IT IS NOT FOR ME THOUGH
p304_343 THERE WASN'T ANYTHING IN IT
p304_345 THINGS START TO TALK TO EACH OTHER
p304_352 THERE IS ROOM FOR ME
p304_354 FOR NEXT SEASON WE HAVE TIME TO RESTRUCTURE
p304_357 THESE WILL TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO DEVELOP
p304_358 THIS IS NOT A BIRTHDAY PARTY
p304_375 ONLY THE DETAILS HAVE TO BE SORTED OUT
p304_387 BUT IT'S A SUBTLE PROCESS
p304_390 CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE
p304_396 I DOUBT IT WOULD BE GENUINE
p304_397 YOU MUST BE READY TO PLAY ANYONE
p304_403 JUST GET ON WITH YOUR JOB
p304_405 HE SAID IT WAS HIS GREATEST WORK
p304_409 WE ARE NOT TOO SURPRISED
p304_413 WHICH IS WORSE
p304_420 THAT THOUGH WAS THEN
p304_421 PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BECOME COMPLACENT
p305_004 WE ALSO NEED A SMALL PLASTIC SNAKE AND A BIG TOY FROG FOR THE KIDS
p305_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p305_017 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
p305_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p305_025 LAST YEAR HOWEVER IT WAS DECIDED TO DISSOLVE THE ABBEY
p305_026 HE ADDED HOWEVER THAT ALL OPTIONS ARE UNDER REVIEW
p305_029 WHICH BRINGS US TO THE SCOTTISH CONNECTION
p305_033 WE HAD A REUNION LAST WEEK
p305_040 IT WOULD SHOW THEM A POSITIVE WAY FORWARD
p305_041 PLAYERS WERE HELD IN EQUALLY LOW REGARD
p305_061 HE DID THE RIGHT THING BY IGNORING ME
p305_070 HOWEVER CONSUMERS MAY TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW
p305_072 HOW DO YOU RESURRECT A DYING TOWN
p305_073 I'VE PUT MY OWN MONEY INTO THIS PROJECT
p305_075 IT'S BEEN A TERRIBLE ORDEAL FOR MARGARET
p305_076 I'M SO PROUD OF MY TEAM
p305_085 THE JURY IS STILL OUT
p305_087 FOR NOW THOUGH MY FUTURE IS WITH RANGERS
p305_090 HIS HANDLING RAISES A WIDER ISSUE
p305_091 THIS IS NOT A RECIPE FOR CONFLICT
p305_093 YOU'VE GOT IT COMING KABUL
p305_094 ALAN MILBURN THE HEALTH SECRETARY REFUSED TO COMMENT
p305_095 WE WILL HAVE TO SEE BUT IT MAKES YOU THINK
p305_096 WE MUST KEEP OUR FEET ON THE GROUND
p305_106 SOME REALISM WAS NEEDED ABOUT TIME RESOURCES AND MANAGEMENT
p305_108 SHE IS A DOUBLE VICTIM
p305_113 SENTENCING IS DUE TO TAKE PLACE TOMORROW MORNING
p305_124 WOMEN WERE MOSTLY NOTABLE BY THEIR ABSENCE
p305_126 I WOULD WELCOME A PROPER PUBLIC DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE
p305_131 ON THIS FORM THEY HAVE A REAL CHANCE OF GOING UP
p305_132 TWO CHARGES OF THREATENING CREW MEMBERS WERE DROPPED
p305_133 YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
p305_143 SLATER WAS FORTUNATE TO BE WEARING A HELMET
p305_147 THEY WERE EVEN BEING USED BY PRIMARY PUPILS
p305_158 WE ARE ASKING THE COUNCIL TO THINK AGAIN
p305_159 HE HAD WORKED THERE FOR ONLY TWO DAYS
p305_160 HOPEFULLY NOW WE'RE GETTING IT
p305_163 THEY WANT TO SHUT THE SCOTTISH OFFICE
p305_164 SCOTLAND NEED TO WORK ON TWO KEY AREAS
p305_171 IT IS SCHEDULED TO GO AHEAD NEXT SATURDAY
p305_175 I GOT ON VERY WELL WITH ALLAN
p305_178 HE WAS LYING FACE DOWN IN THE WATER
p305_184 THE ATTACKER DIED IN THE CRASH
p305_185 I AM NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT THAT
p305_196 EIGHT NEW HOSPITALS ARE SET TO BE BUILT
p305_199 SUDDENLY IT WAS INDEED A NEW BALL GAME
p305_204 IT'S A HIDDEN PROBLEM
p305_213 MY ONLY AMBITION IS TO ENJOY MY WORK
p305_219 THEN THERE'S ONE WHERE PEOPLE PLAY FOR FUN
p305_224 NOW WE SEE THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL POLITICS
p305_226 APPOINTMENTS SHOULD BE MADE ON MERIT
p305_228 I THINK WE WILL JOIN THE SINGLE CURRENCY
p305_229 GILBERT WAS NOT AMUSED
p305_239 SO THE PROCESS WAS REFINED
p305_241 I HAVE BEEN HERE FOR ONLY THREE MONTHS
p305_254 I STILL FEEL LIKE A WEE BOY
p305_255 HE WILL BE SENTENCED TOMORROW BY LORD DAWSON
p305_265 OUR OFFER WILL REMAIN ON THE TABLE
p305_266 HE IS A MAN WHO LIVES TO WORK
p305_277 THEY MARRIED IN AUGUST LAST YEAR
p305_279 HE WAS HAPPY THE BBC WAS HAPPY THE LISTENERS WERE HAPPY
p305_280 THE CASE WILL NOW GO TO APPEAL
p305_289 WE WOULD WELCOME A GREATER EMPHASIS ON CARCASSES
p305_296 I'M QUITE EMBARRASSED AND ASHAMED OF DOING THAT
p305_298 THIS IS A HUGE CONFIDENCE BOOST
p305_309 ONE SEASON THEY MIGHT DO WELL
p305_314 SHE TOLD ME TO APPLY FOR THE CREST
p305_315 I THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD PAY FOR THAT
p305_337 THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT ISN'T IT
p305_338 WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE BEACH BOYS AND BRIAN WILSON
p305_344 SO THERE'S A DOUBLE WHAMMY
p305_357 NOW WE NEED TO KEEP OUR HEADS UP
p305_358 I PUT THE DRAWING DOWN
p305_368 THE DOW JONES IS WAY UP
p305_369 NOW THERE IS AN EVEN BIGGER TARGET
p305_374 THIS MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERE
p305_375 WE'RE ALL IN A STATE OF SHOCK
p305_385 THE COURT HAD A NUMBER OF EMPTY SEATS
p305_396 THE WORKERS SAID THEY WERE TREATED LIKE ANIMALS
p305_398 SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE OUT IN THE STREET
p305_400 A REVIEW GROUP WILL REPORT ON TUESDAY
p305_407 SEE IT WHILE YOU CAN
p305_408 I DIDN'T DO TOO BADLY MYSELF
p305_417 WE'VE STILL GOT A SAY IN THIS
p305_423 NOTHING HAS BEEN GOING FOR US BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO
p306_001 PLEASE CALL STELLA
p306_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION
p306_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATHS HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p306_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p306_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p306_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p306_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p306_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p306_029 OF COURSE THIS IS NICE TO HEAR
p306_031 I DON'T BELIEVE YOU OWN ANYTHING
p306_032 THE MUSIC INDUSTRY HASN'T CHANGED AT ALL
p306_040 SOME PEOPLE BEGIN TO TURN AWAY TO GO HOME
p306_041 YOU'RE NOT STOPPING PEOPLE USING SUNBEDS
p306_050 EXCEPT FOR THIS IT WAS OFFSIDE
p306_055 UNTIL RECENTLY SHE WORKED AS A RECRUITMENT CONSULTANT IN LONDON
p306_059 HE WAS TAKEN ILL IN DECEMBER LAST YEAR
p306_061 IT'S ALL TOO SHORT TERM
p306_065 HIS RIVAL'S ARE SPOKEN WITH ELAN
p306_083 THEY ARE NOT AN ITEM
p306_100 MY OFFICE IS BARE
p306_104 AFTER ALL HE IS THE KING OF SCOTLAND
p306_107 THE CULTURE IS EXTREMELY WIDESPREAD AND VIBRANT
p306_114 I DIDN'T REALISE IT HAD REACHED THAT STAGE
p306_126 THERE IS A LACK OF CHEMISTRY
p306_129 DOES A FIREFIGHTER HAVE TO BE KILLED
p306_146 THEY SAID TO ME WHY DON'T YOU GET INTO ACTING TOMMY
p306_152 WE CAME ACROSS THE FIRST SET OF BODIES
p306_155 YOU'VE SEEN THE POLLS THEN SEAN
p306_156 THIS IS A FOOLISH IDEA
p306_160 SHE COLLAPSED AND DIED A DAY LATER
p306_163 I TOOK A MINIBUS INTO TOWN
p306_166 RUNNING COSTS ARE NOT SUBSIDISED BY PUBLIC MONEY
p306_177 IT SHOWS THAT WE ARE A CIVILISED SOCIETY
p306_183 THIS ONE WAS MY BEST CHANCE
p306_187 ALL WERE PAID BY THE TAXPAYER
p306_189 IT WAS LOCATED ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
p306_195 I WOULD LIKE GLASGOW
p306_196 THE FBI COULD BECOME INVOLVED
p306_204 DONALD WAS A MAN WITH MANY FRIENDS
p306_216 JIMMY RETURNED TO ABERDEEN BUT SHE REMAINED WITH GEORGE
p306_224 THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THIS BACK HOME
p306_225 AND THAT GIVES A KIND OF FREEDOM
p306_228 THEY MAY YET HAVE THE LAST LAUGH
p306_229 YOU CAN FEEL AT HOME IN CHINA
p306_230 THIS IS ALL PART OF BEING OPENING THE DOOR
p306_232 FOR THE OTHER PARTIES IT IS BACK TO BUSINESS AS USUAL
p306_240 WAS ALL THIS REALLY JUST FIVE MONTHS AGO
p306_241 THE PROPERTY IS OWNED BY GLASGOW CITY COUNCIL
p306_243 IT NEED NOT BE LIKE THAT
p306_252 I JUST SAW THEM FOR A FEW MINUTES
p306_258 TODAY'S MEETING WAS OPEN AND FRIENDLY
p306_260 HE MUST HAVE SOMETHING UP HIS SLEEVE
p306_264 HISTORY MAY REPEAT ITSELF WITH BILLY ELLIOT
p306_270 THE MAIN THING IS THAT THEY ENJOY IT
p306_283 I'M GOING TO HELP OUT IN THE SUMMER AS PRODUCER
p306_299 THEY FINISHED SECOND AND THIRD
p306_305 PEOPLE CAN GET THEM IF THEY WANT
p306_308 HE IS A LAW UNTO HIMSELF
p306_314 IT WAS JUST COMPLETELY ERASED
p306_316 I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR A YEAR
p306_319 I TEND TO NOT LOOK BACK
p306_322 TECHNICALLY IT WAS A VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE BY SCOTLAND
p306_331 HOWEVER WITHIN FIVE MINUTES THEY WERE ABLE TO CELEBRATE
p306_332 HE MADE NO BIG MISTAKES
p306_336 SIX OF THE ASYLUM SEEKERS LEFT THE OFFICES IT WAS REPORTED
p306_341 WE WON'T LET YOU DOWN
p306_344 HE WAS VISITED BY UK CONSULAR OFFICIALS
p306_347 THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT IS DESTROYING THE PEACE PROCESS
p306_352 WHO HAS THE SECOND HIGHEST
p306_354 YOU CAN LEAVE HIM KNOWING THE JOB WILL BE DONE
p306_357 I'VE ONLY MET HIM THREE TIMES
p307_001 PLEASE CALL STELLA
p307_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION
p307_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p307_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p307_010 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
p307_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p307_027 YOU NEED A LONG-TERM STRATEGY IN FOOTBALL
p307_028 THE LAW HAS GOT TO BE UPHELD
p307_032 THE PUNISHMENT WAS SWIFT
p307_034 I KEPT MY SIDE OF THE BARGAIN
p307_043 PARTS OF THE SYSTEM ARE ALREADY OVERSTRETCHED
p307_046 SHE ADDED IT IS THE SAME STORY IN BOTH COUNTRIES
p307_056 NO IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT OFFICIALS ADMITTED
p307_057 I KEEP MY FINGERS CROSSED
p307_061 THAT IS WHY WE WANT THIS DECISION REVERSED
p307_062 IT DIDN'T WORK AGAINST SWEDEN BUT THAT WAS THE INTENTION
p307_064 WE TRIED EVERYTHING BUT IT JUST WASN'T TO BE TODAY
p307_068 CELTIC CONNECTIONS IS HERE AGAIN - AND THE GREAT DEBATE
p307_072 MICHAEL IS PUTTING ON A BRAVE FACE
p307_089 HE IS FIRM BUT INCLUSIVE AND VERY FAIR
p307_092 ONE FILM A YEAR IS HE SAYS HIS NATURAL RHYTHM
p307_097 HE WAS MARRIED WITH A YOUNG CHILD
p307_101 BUT HIS ATTENDANCE IS NOT GUARANTEED

p307_126 TONY BLAIR SHOULD GET OUT MORE
p307_135 HOW GOOD IS LENNOX LEWIS

p307_155 I WAS LOVING THAT LITTLE GIRL
p307_170 THE PRESSURE ON THE AID AGENCIES IS IMMENSE
p307_171 THE PROBLEM ARISES BECAUSE HE DOES SO MUCH
p307_176 THAT WILL BE THE SWEETNESS
p307_181 THIS DOES NOT CREATE ANY PRECEDENT
p307_183 IT HAS REMOVED A BIT OF GUILT
p307_185 YOU CAN SAY HE GETS A SIZEABLE AMOUNT
p307_188 I HOPE YOU MISS THE CUT
p307_192 THAT THOUGH WAS AGAIN ACCORDING TO THE MANAGER MCCALL
p307_194 I HATE TO SAY IT BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT
p307_206 IT OPENS THE DOOR TO THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE
p307_210 THEY ALWAYS WANT TO GIVE A PERFORMANCE
p307_220 ALL THE LADS ARE TOTALLY FOCUSED ON THAT
p307_226 IF NOT A DEAL COULD TAKE MANY MONTHS
p307_230 SULLIVAN WAS LATER CHARGED WITH HER MURDER WHICH SHE DENIED
p307_235 CORRECTION KNOWING HIM HE MIGHT
p307_237 WHY DOES SHE SUDDENLY WIN EVERYTHING NOW
p307_241 THAT IS NEARLY FOUR PEOPLE EVERY DAY
p307_246 IT WASN'T A PENALTY IT WAS OUTSIDE THE AREA
p307_249 I SAW MILITARY VEHICLES IN THE DISTANCE
p307_263 WE ARE TRYING TO CLARIFY THE ISSUES
p307_265 HE WAS TELLING ME TO KEEP QUIET
p307_272 DRINK AND PETROL PRICES REMAIN UNTOUCHED
p307_276 MANY OTHER SCOTTISH LOCATIONS ALSO FEATURE
p307_281 THIS WILL SECURE THE FUTURE OF OUR INDUSTRY
p307_282 THE POLICE HAVE AN AWFUL LOT TO EXPLAIN
p307_285 IT WAS AN EMPOWERING JOURNEY
p307_287 IT'S NOT UNLIKE THE MILLENNIUM BUG
p307_295 BROOMFIELD WAS THE CENTRE OF THE TOWN
p307_296 HE OR SHE WILL OVERSEE THE LEADERSHIP CONTEST
p307_314 IT SOUNDS A BIT OF AN OWN GOAL
p307_316 WE LOST OUR COMPOSURE TOWARDS THE INTERVAL HE SAID
p307_317 I LOOK FOR DANCERS WHO ARE ALSO ACTORS
p307_319 EMI IS A PRIME EXAMPLE
p307_324 A FRIENDSHIP THAT WILL ENDURE
p307_325 TOURISM IS A VITAL INDUSTRY FOR SCOTLAND
p307_326 IT NEEDS TO BE SORTED OUT BY EASTER
p307_327 NOWADAYS IT IS WORKERS UNITED
p307_328 HE IS YOUNG BUT NOT TOO YOUNG
p307_343 BOB DYLAN IS GETTING OLD
p307_352 LAW ABIDING MOTORISTS HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR
p307_354 CLEARLY SHE SAYS SHE WOULD NEVER RESORT TO SUCH DEVICES
p307_357 THEY WERE THE BEST TEAM BUT UNLUCKY IN THE END
p307_363 THEY HAVE SHOWN A GREAT DESIRE AND ATTITUDE
p307_366 BUT HE IS REVELLING IN THE BIG STAGE
p307_372 HIS JOB WAS NOT ADVERTISED
p307_374 SCOTTISH LIFE CAN BE LIKE THIS TOO
p307_378 THERE IS NO OPENNESS
p307_379 IT'S BEING VERY CAREFULLY LOOKED AT
p307_382 FILTERING THROUGH THIS MATERIAL A COMPOSITE FINALE EMERGES
p307_393 MCMASTER HAD ALREADY SEEN THE FIRST PART
p307_394 IT'S ABOUT MY TIME AS A GUITARIST
p307_396 IT WAS EARLY MORNING
p307_400 ANYWAY EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T IT WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED
p307_407 MY THOUGHTS ARE WITH THEIR FAMILIES
p308_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p308_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p308_008 THEY TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p308_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
p308_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p308_024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
p308_035 HOW COME IT IS SO OFTEN UNNOTICED
p308_038 IT'S A DELIGHTFUL IDEA BUT A DISTANCING ONE
p308_039 ALL OF US DO
p308_043 THEATRE IS NOT A MUSEUM
p308_052 HE SERVED IN THE GULF THE FALKLANDS AND NORTHERN IRELAND
p308_053 WE HAVE TO REINFORCE THE PRESSURE ON IRAQ
p308_055 THE DAYS OF EMPTY PROMISES ARE OVER
p308_060 MS MCNEILL WAS KILLED ON IMPACT

p308_079 I WAS IN JAIL FOR FIVE YEARS
p308_081 A SPOKESMAN FOR LOTHIAN AND BORDERS POLICE SAID
p308_104 EARLY WARNINGS COULD HELP BUT IT'S A SCARY THOUGHT
p308_107 YOU'LL GET ON LIKE A HOUSE ON FIRE
p308_120 BRITAIN MAY NOW BE FORCED TO LISTEN
p308_122 GLASGOW IS MAKING INROADS IN SOME AREAS
p308_126 AND PERHAPS IT IS AS SIMPLE AS THAT

p308_160 COUNCILLOR GORDON HAS REFUSED TO STAND DOWN
p308_165 HOWEVER THE REFEREE WAS NOT IN THE GIVING VEIN
p308_170 BUT SHE'S ALSO BEAUTIFUL BEHIND THE FACE
p308_171 THERE IS NO DATE ON THIS DOCUMENT
p308_178 FOR NOW WE MUST TAKE ONE GAME AT A TIME
p308_179 I WILL HAVE TO ORDER ITS DESTRUCTION
p308_180 I FOOLISHLY HAD DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT
p308_183 SMITH HAS NOT LET HIM DOWN
p308_185 REVIVING THE SCOTTISH OPEN IS ONE OPTION
p308_187 LUCKILY OUR PATIENT WAS STABLE
p308_189 PEOPLE BUY EVERYTHING WITH CASH
p308_194 OR SO WE HAVE LONG ASSUMED
p308_195 PUBLIC CONFIDENCE WAS UNDERMINED BY THAT TERRIBLE TRAGEDY
p308_203 THEY COULD TAKE THE RESULT AWAY FROM THEM COULDN'T THEY
p308_204 HAVE WE NOT HAD THE RAINY SEASON ALREADY
p308_211 THIS IS A ONE-YEAR DEAL BUT WHO KNOWS
p308_215 IS THIS ACCURATE
p308_216 A JUDICIAL REVIEW IS ALSO BEING CONSIDERED
p308_218 THEY COULD GO NO FURTHER FORWARD
p308_225 NO MEANINGFUL RESPONSE WAS ISSUED
p308_230 SURVIVAL IS OUR AIM
p308_241 THERE WAS NO SAFETY NET
p308_251 WE ARE NOT OUT OF TOUCH WITH POLITICS
p308_252 WE COULD HAVE GOT THREE MEDALS
p308_253 EVERYTHING HAPPENED SO QUICKLY THAT WE WERE TAKEN BY SURPRISE
p308_259 OF COURSE WE MAKE MISTAKES BUT WE DON'T MAKE TOO MANY
p308_263 SHE SAID HE SHOWED NO REMORSE
p308_272 I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY GOT THERE BUT THEY ARE
p308_273 AND THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR THE MAGPIES
p308_280 HOWEVER THE MOVE WAS BITTERLY CRITICISED LAST NIGHT
p308_283 DO YOURSELVES A FAVOUR
p308_285 OTHERS SAID THEY HAD BEEN BEATEN BY POLICE
p308_287 I'D LOVE TO BE LIKE PETER
p308_299 I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING
p308_301 SHAKING HIS HEAD MR COOK SAID HE SIMPLY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT
p308_313 TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HE RAN THE SHOW
p308_318 SO THE QUESTION IS IS IT ANY GOOD
p308_319 I'M GETTING BACK UP THERE NOW
p308_323 I'M GETTING LONG IN THE TOOTH
p308_326 SOME OLD FAVOURITES REMAIN IN VARYING FORMS
p308_330 THEN WE WILL FACE THE DANISH CHAMPIONS
p308_331 I'D GO TO BOOKSHOPS
p308_338 YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT AUDIENCE
p308_340 BY THEN HOWEVER BOTH MEN WERE ALREADY IN THE US
p308_341 SHE'S A VALUABLE MEMBER OF THE GOVERNMENT
p308_352 HIS REPLACEMENT WAS NAMED YESTERDAY FOLLOWING INQUIRIES BY THE HERALD
p308_356 THIS IS A DREADFUL DAY FOR IONA
p308_359 THE DISCUSSIONS WILL SURELY NOT LAST TOO LONG
p308_365 LAST NIGHT WAS A KEY EPISODE
p308_366 I GREW UP LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE
p308_376 WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AND REMAIN CONFIDENT OF SECURING THE ORDER
p308_384 THIS GIVES A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO SWITCH
p308_385 IT IS A TRIUMPHANT PERFORMANCE WHICH DEFIES THE YEARS
p308_396 AT PRESENT IT IS FAIRLY UNCOMMON BUT ITS INCIDENCE IS INCREASING
p308_411 SUTTON IS PLAYING AS WELL AS EVER TODAY
p308_415 SHE TOOK THEM FOR A TERM
p310_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p310_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES THE RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p310_017 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
p310_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p310_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p310_040 NOTHING IS LOST EVERYTHING IS RECYCLED
p310_044 NORMALLY THEY HAVE BEEN A PACK OF LIES
p310_045 HE MOVED BACK TO EDINBURGH WHERE HE LIVED WITH HIS MOTHER
p310_049 THEY HAD FOUR CHILDREN TOGETHER
p310_052 I FELL TO THE GROUND
p310_058 MORAY COUNCIL COULD NOT BE CONTACTED LAST NIGHT
p310_062 WE'RE INTO THAT BUILD-UP NOW
p310_064 WE SHALL NOT DO THAT
p310_067 ONCE AGAIN HE REFUSED
p310_072 APART FROM THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE MAKING ANY COMMENT
p310_076 BOTH WILL BE HEARD AT GLASGOW SHERIFF COURT
p310_078 ARE YOU WATCHING LIVERPOOL
p310_080 THEY SEEM TO BE BACKING OFF FROM THAT
p310_097 IT IS A DIFFICULT THING TO EXPLAIN
p310_098 I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED
p310_099 PETER DOESN'T WANT TO LEAVE
p310_109 SERGIO WAS TALKING HIS CHANCES DOWN YESTERDAY
p310_112 I WILL NOT BE IN DIALOGUE WITH HER
p310_114 DRUGS AND HOUSEBREAKING ARE LINKED
p310_121 AND WHO WERE THEY ANYWAY BEFOREHAND
p310_125 MEANWHILE RANGERS WILL CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR A STRIKER
p310_135 NO DATE HAS BEEN SET FOR THE APPEAL
p310_141 THEY RECEIVE A HIGH PROFILE IN THE MEDIA
p310_142 IT WAS AN AMBUSH
p310_151 AND THAT WAS THE ADULTS
p310_155 WE STARTED WITH THAT
p310_156 AND HE HAD MUCH NEED
p310_157 LAST NIGHT THE BOMBARDMENT WAS TERRIBLE
p310_159 IT'S NEVER THE SAME PROBLEM
p310_164 AND REALLY THE SONGS ARE THE KEY THING
p310_165 FOUR MINUTES LATER THE SHOW WAS OVER
p310_172 HIS TRACK RECORD IS NOT PROMISING
p310_180 WHAT IF THE CONFESSION IS AFTER ALL A FAKE
p310_189 BUT EVEN WITHOUT EITHER GLASGOW WILL BE OUTSTANDING
p310_202 I WANTED REALLY TO DEAL WITH TWO OPPOSITE ENERGIES
p310_205 THEY WILL WANT TO WATCH A WINNING TEAM
p310_210 ONE MUST HOPE NOT
p310_212 JUST SEE WHERE THE BLOOD IS COMING FROM
p310_222 IT SHOULDN'T COME AS A SURPRISE BUT IT DOES
p310_229 I GET TO WORK WITH VERY GOOD PEOPLE
p310_233 OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE IS NOT DOING THEIR JOB PROPERLY
p310_234 LOOK AT THE TABLE
p310_237 COMMITTING SUICIDE IS NOT A CRIMINAL OFFENCE
p310_242 MY PREFERENCE IS FOR THE SINGLE VACCINES
p310_257 NO IS THE ANSWER TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION
p310_262 THAT'S THE DAY JOB
p310_268 THAT KIND OF GROWTH IS THE IMPORTANT THING
p310_273 AND YET HIS LEGACY IS DOUBTFUL
p310_282 I'D NEVER HEARD HIM IN PERSON BEFORE
p310_283 WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE OUR PARTY
p310_284 CHARLES KENNEDY HAD AN EFFECTIVE OUTING
p310_288 A FORMAL DECISION WILL BE ANNOUNCED WITHIN MONTHS
p310_289 HE MUST HAVE SOMETHING UP HIS SLEEVE
p310_290 HE WAS AT HOME WITH HIS PALS
p310_291 WE MAKE GOOD WEAPONS
p310_293 THIS IS NOT A SCOTTISH PROBLEM
p310_298 WE HAD NO PART IN IT
p310_299 IT WASN'T SO PATHETIC IT WOULD BE FUNNY
p310_302 OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE LEAVING
p310_312 BOTH AGREED ON THE SUCCESS OF THE EVENT
p310_313 WHAT THEN IS THE REAL THING
p310_320 ON SATURDAY IT WAS MUCH THE SAME
p310_325 THERE IS NO THREAT TO THEM
p310_326 NELSON DOES NOT DISAPPOINT
p310_330 IT IS A HIGH TIME TO ACT
p310_347 THE NEW WORK WILL BEGIN IN THE AUTUMN
p310_350 OR DO THEY
p310_351 THEY ARE THE INNOCENT VICTIMS
p310_355 NOW IT IS MEASURING IT IN DOLLARS
p310_363 I LOVE THE MOMENT OF BEING FIRST
p310_365 THEIR MIND WAS ALREADY MADE UP
p310_379 THAT IS WHY IT'S SO LYRICAL
p310_381 I'VE HEARD THIS STUFF ABOUT THE MARKETS
p310_383 IT HAS REMOVED A BIT OF GUILT
p310_384 AND THEY ALL HAD THESE OTHER COMMITMENTS
p310_391 HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING FROM PARAMOUNT
p310_405 AND THAT STARTED ME THINKING
p310_408 IS IT THE PLAYERS OR IS IT THE COACHES
p310_416 THEY'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE
p310_417 I WANT A FREE VOTE
p311_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION
p311_029 IT WAS A MATTER OF CHANCE
p311_035 WITH ACTORS IT IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
p311_037 THEY DID A VERY GOOD JOB
p311_043 I KNEW MY CONTRACT WAS UP THIS YEAR
p311_054 AS A NATION WE MUST BECOME MORE ACTIVE
p311_058 I JUST WENT A BIT TOO FAR
p311_060 HIS THIRD GOAL WAS SUPERB
p311_066 IN THE END HOWEVER IT ALL CAME TOGETHER
p311_097 THE INITIAL REPORT HAS BEEN COMPLETED
p311_099 IT'S LIKE AN EXTENSION OF YOUR BODY
p311_101 JOHNSEN IS EQUALLY CONCERNED
p311_106 HE TOO WILL RETURN
p311_109 JUST WATCH THE VIDEOS AND YOU'LL SEE IT
p311_129 THE HEARING WAS CONTINUED UNTIL A LATER DATE
p311_130 STILL SOME ADDITIONS ARE INSPIRED
p311_133 THE WAY AHEAD IS NOT EASY
p311_140 IT'S A HORRIFIC INCIDENT
p311_145 THERE WAS ONLY ONE PROBLEM THE TEACHER WAS STILL THERE
p311_152 NOW SHE HAS COMPLETED A FAMILY TRADITION
p311_157 HE WAS PART OF SOUTH AFRICA
p311_164 HE CHANGED MY LIFE
p311_165 THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO MATCH IT
p311_168 THE CRITERIA HAVE CHANGED
p311_173 THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING MOVE
p311_176 THOSE WHO ARE PREPARING TO GIVE UP
p311_184 THIS MAY BE PERFECTLY INNOCENT
p311_218 WOULD IT BE GOOD FOR THE NATIONWIDE LEAGUE
p311_220 THE WHOLE THING HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE
p311_228 I NEVER MADE ANY OFFER TO MARK
p311_231 THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO COVER UP
p311_239 IT'S NOT A PARTY NO NO
p311_245 EVERYONE MUST BE FOCUSED ON THE LEAGUE
p311_249 HOWEVER MANY OF THEIR VICTORIES HAVE BEEN CLOSE AFFAIRS
p311_251 MENTALLY YOU HAVE TO BE TOUGH
p311_252 HE HAS TO PULL BACK FROM THE BRINK
p311_256 THE PERFORMANCE WAS REALLY REALLY IMMENSE
p311_257 FACES FROM THE EIGHTIES
p311_261 I WANT TO GO NOW
p311_262 THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED
p311_263 OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH HER FAMILY
p311_269 THE KIDS ARE PAYING THE PRICE
p311_277 THERE'S A LOT OF HYSTERIA
p311_278 THE CASUALTIES WERE NOT NAMED
p311_279 I WAS SHAKING ON THE BLOCKS
p311_282 AWARENESS IN EUROPE OF SCOTLAND IS HIGH
p311_287 THE DEFENDER MADE AN IMPRESSIVE DEBUT
p311_288 IT HAS BECOME VERY CONFUSED
p311_289 FAME AND MONEY FOLLOWED
p311_291 SHELTER ALSO SUPPORTS THE REFORM
p311_293 THERE IS A SOLUTION SHE BELIEVES
p311_296 THEN THERE'S THE OLD FIRM
p311_298 WE WERE IN DIFFERENT PLACES USUALLY IN CELLARS
p311_301 HE SAID HE WAS SORRY
p311_302 MY POSITION ON THE EURO IS QUITE CLEAR
p311_307 THAT IS WHEN WE ARE REALLY EFFECTIVE
p311_309 THERE WAS NO SIGN THAT ANYTHING WAS AMISS
p311_310 IT WAS THE CLIMAX OF THE THING
p311_319 IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE FOR THE AUDIENCE
p311_320 WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS
p311_321 THIS WAS ANOTHER VIDEO CASSETTE
p311_323 IT WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE
p311_329 BUT THAT'S NOT THE IDEA BEHIND THIS ARTICLE
p311_330 IF HE COULD'VE PREVENTED IT HAPPENING HE WOULD HAVE
p311_331 THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE
p311_340 THIS GOVERNMENT IS CUTTING TAXES
p311_342 THIS IS A BIG CLUB
p311_343 I COULDN'T QUITE BELIEVE IT AND STILL CAN'T
p311_361 THE ACTORS ARE CONFIDENT AND POLISHED
p311_362 I HOPE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED
p311_365 IT'S UNUSUAL TO SAY THE LEAST
p311_372 THEY REALLY WANT TO DO IT
p311_373 AND THEN HE LAUGHS
p311_374 I RECOMMEND A TOUR
p311_378 WE HAVE TO START AGAIN ON SATURDAY
p311_395 NOBODY CAN TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME
p311_398 WHO CAN SAY
p311_403 THE MEN ARE SAFE AND UNHARMED
p311_406 I WAS FRUSTRATED HERE
p311_408 ARE YOU WATCHING LIVERPOOL
p311_409 I WAS FURIOUS ABOUT IT
p311_411 THEY KNEW THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE
p311_413 WE HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD
p311_422 IT'S SOMETHING WE WANT TO MAKE WORK
p311_423 THERE WILL BE NO EXCUSES ON WEDNESDAY
p312_004 WE ALSO NEED A SMALL PLASTIC SNAKE AND A BIG TOY FROG FOR THE KIDS
p312_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p312_017 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
p312_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASE AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p312_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p312_025 PERHAPS THAT WAS THEIR MISTAKE
p312_026 THIS WAS A RATIONING DECISION
p312_027 THE WAY FORWARD IS WORKING WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES
p312_029 BLOOD SAMPLES WERE TAKEN
p312_030 I'VE GOT THE POSTER
p312_031 THIS IS EXCELLENT NEWS FOR THE WORKFORCE
p312_039 I WISH IT WASN'T SO BUT IT IS
p312_041 I SHOULDN'T HAVE PUT UP WITH IT
p312_053 IN FACT IT MIGHT JUST BE THE BEGINNING
p312_056 MY ONLY CONCERN IS FOR MY CHILDREN
p312_058 THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM DOESN'T DELIVER
p312_061 IT WAS A VIRUS
p312_065 ALL WERE LATER ALLOWED HOME
p312_069 IT IS STILL WITH MINISTERS
p312_084 THERE ARE MANY CHILDREN
p312_087 I WAS BROUGHT UP IN A MINING BACKGROUND
p312_091 BUT THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING NOW
p312_095 IT WILL BE A CHALLENGING FILM
p312_101 THE SCHEME IS HOPELESSLY FAILING
p312_102 THEY'RE JUST A NONSENSE
p312_115 THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S ANYTHING BUT OPEN
p312_120 WE ARE SATISFIED THAT THIS IS THE CASE
p312_127 WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
p312_128 THE PAIN IS STILL ACUTE
p312_129 HIS REMIT IS SPECIFIC
p312_137 I WAS BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION
p312_141 HE WAS THE ARCHITECT
p312_158 THAT SAYS SOMETHING FOR HIS STRENGTH OF CHARACTER
p312_170 A NUMBER OF PEOPLE COULD NOT SPEAK ENGLISH
p312_173 THIS REMAINS THE PARTY'S POLICY
p312_176 ROBERT IS A SPECIAL TALENT
p312_187 WE PLAYED TOO DEEPLY
p312_197 I AM DESPERATE TO PLAY FOR SCOTLAND
p312_200 HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY
p312_201 NOW THERE'S A THOUGHT
p312_202 I BELIEVE THAT THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE
p312_203 THAT HE CLAIMED WAS ESSENTIAL
p312_218 I PLAYED WELL IN MY TIME THERE
p312_219 A TEACHER IS REALLY ABOUT UNITY
p312_220 THEY ARE STILL GOING TO BE IMPULSIVE
p312_225 SEAN CONNERY DID NOT DISAPPOINT
p312_228 IT WAS NO AVAIL
p312_230 HE WAS REPLACED BY JOHN SPENCER
p312_240 OUR COMMITMENT IS TO MOVE FORWARD
p312_244 I WON'T GO BACK
p312_246 YOU MAKE THE CHOICE
p312_248 I WAS PROUD OF OUR LADS
p312_250 THIS KIND OF TRAFFIC IS COMMONPLACE
p312_254 PERHAPS IT WAS HER DEMEANOUR
p312_258 THE CLAIM WAS DENIED BY FIRST MINISTER
p312_266 YOU ARE A LIAR
p312_271 I'M NOT AFRAID OF THAT
p312_274 IT WAS A NEW BALL GAME
p312_275 THE PEOPLE HERE ARE QUITE RESERVED
p312_277 OUR LEGAL ADVICE IS CLEAR
p312_284 KNOWLEDGE IS EVERYTHING AT THIS LEVEL
p312_285 INQUIRIES ARE ONGOING INTO THIS INCIDENT
p312_292 TREVOR HAS BEEN GREAT
p312_297 IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY
p312_302 WHAT MAKES A HOUSE A HOME
p312_315 SHE HAS LEFT THE ISLAND
p312_319 WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE POLICY
p312_322 WE DON'T HAVE THE CREDIBLE EVIDENCE
p312_323 THAT WILL BE THE CASE ON TUESDAY
p312_327 THERE IS STILL HOPE
p312_334 HOWEVER SHE IS FEMALE AND SO
p312_337 BUT HE DID NOT RULE OUT FURTHER TALKS
p312_341 THIS TIME WE MAY NOT BE SEEKING VOLUNTEERS
p312_344 THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR ME
p312_352 AND SHE'S NOT EVEN IN THE BOOK
p312_358 IT'S JUST SO SAD
p312_360 AND SCOTLAND IS NO DIFFERENT
p312_363 HE CAN DO EVERYTHING
p312_381 HOWEVER THIS SUGGESTION WAS TURNED DOWN BY THE PLAYER
p312_389 THAT'S AN OLD IDEA
p312_408 THERE WAS SOMEONE ON THE FLOOR
p312_411 IT WAS CHAOTIC AND FRIGHTENING
p312_412 FRIDAY NIGHT WAS A PRETTY GOOD NIGHT
p312_419 THERE WAS NO PRESSURE AT ALL
p313_004 WE ALSO NEED A SMALL PLASTIC SNAKE AND A BIG TOY FROG FOR THE KIDS
p313_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p313_025 THEY WILL BE DEALT WITH
p313_029 HOWEVER IT'S GOOD TO TURN THE PAGE
p313_038 I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SAY THAT OF COURSE
p313_039 IT HELPED ME TO GET NOTICED
p313_050 MY BROTHER'S BURIED UNDER THERE
p313_051 THEIR CONDITIONS ARE DESCRIBED AS SERIOUS BUT STABLE
p313_066 HE GOT HIS DEGREE
p313_067 SANDY WAS VERY ACTIVE
p313_075 I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT THE ROADS
p313_077 HE WAS CONVICTED AT GLASGOW SHERIFF COURT
p313_080 DID THEY GIVE ANY GOOD ADVICE
p313_081 WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE
p313_093 THERE'S ALSO THE POINT
p313_095 OF COURSE WE KNOW THEM FROM THEIR WORK IN THE THEATRE
p313_096 THAT'S THE NATIONAL GRID
p313_104 WE SHALL BE VICTORIOUS
p313_108 I THINK THE SCOTTISH BID IS VERY STRONG
p313_109 NOTHING IS BEING OFFERED IN EXCHANGE
p313_113 WE PLAYED SO WELL AT TIMES
p313_120 THE TORY PARTY WILL LAST
p313_121 IT WAS A JOURNEY INTO A NEW LIFE
p313_122 IT'S A WAY OF MAKING A MARK
p313_124 LIFE AS MANY PEOPLE KNOW IT IN OTHER WORDS
p313_141 THAT SORT OF THING IS LONG GONE
p313_150 STILL IN THE END IT WAS A FAIR RESULT
p313_152 I AM ASHAMED OF THEM
p313_161 I CAN MAKE ONE FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENT
p313_162 THE GENERAL ELECTION IS ALL TO PLAY FOR
p313_163 IT WAS A FIERY GAME
p313_165 GOLF IS A GAME OF HONOUR AND ETHICS
p313_168 THIS ONE IS A SPECIAL CASE
p313_169 BUT WHAT ARE THE SONGS ABOUT
p313_178 ANY ERROR IS SEVERELY PUNISHED
p313_188 HIS MANAGER BLAMED THE REFEREE
p313_193 ALL THESE THINGS HAVE AN IMPACT
p313_198 THIS IS A REALLY SERIOUS ISSUE
p313_199 SO THEY WILL SETTLE AGAIN
p313_205 SO SHE TOLD HIM
p313_210 SADLY TOO MANY OF THEM ARE SIMILAR
p313_211 I SUSPECT THAT IT WILL
p313_212 BUT THERE'S NO EYE CONTACT
p313_221 IT SOUNDS LIKE AN APPALLING TRAGIC INCIDENT
p313_222 IF NOT HE SHOULD GO HOME
p313_237 WE HAVE THE SUPPORT OF SCOTTISH NATURAL HERITAGE
p313_239 I WAS AN ATHLETE
p313_241 WORLD LEADERS EXPRESSED THEIR SYMPATHY
p313_247 I WANTED TO PUT MYSELF ON THE LINE
p313_248 I THOUGHT THEY COULD HAVE MADE THE GESTURE
p313_257 NOR IS IT LIKELY TO DO SO
p313_265 BY THIS POINT THE COUPLE WERE APPROACHING FAST
p313_272 THERE WAS STILL MORE DISQUIET IN ISRAEL
p313_279 WHY SHOULD HE GO ANYWHERE
p313_280 ONE THING IS SURE
p313_283 FUNDING NEEDS TO BE LONG TERM
p313_284 IT'S FUNNY HOW IT COMES AND GOES
p313_290 PAINFUL BUT ONLY BECAUSE IT'S TRUE
p313_291 IT'S NEVER OVER UNTIL IT'S OVER
p313_292 COLONEL ABOUT THIS COMMITTEE THAT IS COMING
p313_302 I CAN FEEL THE SOUND INSIDE
p313_303 I'M SURE EVERYONE WILL BE DELIGHTED FOR THEM
p313_307 I NEVER HAD ANY CONFIDENCE IN IT AFTERWARDS
p313_311 COULD YOU PUT IT IN WRITING
p313_312 I'M NOT A PAEDOPHILE
p313_322 BUT WILL THEY FALL IN LOVE
p313_329 THIS IS THE LOGIC OF PUNISHMENT ASSAULTS
p313_332 THREE PEOPLE WERE PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE SCENE
p313_335 I DIDN'T WANT TO FALL OUT WITH ANYONE
p313_343 IT'S NO LESS INTRIGUING HOWEVER
p313_346 MY HEART IS NOT SO SURE
p313_350 I SHALL BE VOTING YES TO SUPPORT HIM
p313_357 IT SEEMS VERY ODD
p313_371 I SEE IT AS MY JOB
p313_375 THAT WAS NEVER THEIR AGENDA
p313_377 SHE'S CURRENTLY IN FOSTER CARE
p313_380 THEY WERE OUTSTANDING AND THOROUGHLY DESERVED THEIR WIN
p313_381 IT IS HOWEVER AN UNLIKELY OUTCOME
p313_383 IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME ISN'T IT
p313_391 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES
p313_394 YOU CAN'T GO BACK AND CHANGE THINGS
p313_409 HE DESERVES A TOP TEAM
p313_410 I KNEW PEOPLE ON THAT COMMITTEE
p313_413 HER GRAND-DAUGHTER WAS UNINJURED
p313_416 BUT IT'S NOT THE END OF SCOTTISH FOOTBALL
p314_010 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
p314_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p314_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p314_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p314_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p314_032 IT WAS NOT THE GREATEST PERFORMANCE BUT IT WAS EFFECTIVE
p314_034 IT'S ABOUT BRINGING PEOPLE IN BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS
p314_039 HIS CONCERN IS ONLY FOR THE FUTURE
p314_043 I'M DELIGHTED WITH HOW HE HAS COME THROUGH
p314_047 I ONLY HALF BELIEVE IT
p314_054 THAT THOUGH IS THE MEASURE OF THE MAN
p314_069 THEY KNEW THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE
p314_075 SO FAR THIS SEASON THIS APPROACH IS WORKING
p314_083 I LIKE MANY OTHERS WILL CONSIDER WHERE WE GO FROM HERE
p314_087 IT OPENS THE DOOR TO THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE
p314_094 THEY ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER
p314_109 THAT IS NEARLY FOUR PEOPLE EVERY DAY
p314_118 HE WOULD JUST SAY IT WAS TERRIBLE
p314_119 THEY HAVE GOT THEIR POSITION WE HAVE GOT OUR POSITION
p314_120 THAT'S NOT FAIR TO THE SUPPORTERS
p314_124 THERE ARE A LOT OF EXAMPLES
p314_126 BUT THEN HE CHANGED HIS MIND
p314_127 I REALLY HOPE HE THINKS THAT THROUGH
p314_144 SCOTLAND HAS BEEN CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE
p314_145 WE ARE TRYING TO CLARIFY THE ISSUES
p314_149 HE WAS TELLING ME TO KEEP QUIET
p314_154 WE HAVEN'T SEEN FROM THE BANK OF SCOTLAND
p314_155 BUT WE ARE NOT IMMUNE TO THE PROBLEM
p314_157 IT'S ALL TOO SHORT TERM
p314_163 I'D SAY WE SHOULD GIVE IT A WEEK
p314_171 HE REALISES HE HAS HIT A GLASS CEILING
p314_174 I WAS NEVER ALONE WITH HER RIGHT
p314_176 THAT NATION IS SOUTH AFRICA
p314_177 THIS WILL SECURE THE FUTURE OF OUR INDUSTRY
p314_181 WEDNESDAY'S DECISION CAME AS A SURPRISE
p314_193 THAT IS A TREND WHICH WILL BE ENCOURAGED
p314_202 WE DON'T WANT TO BE TOO INTRUSIVE
p314_203 WE JUST WANT TO GET STUCK IN NOW
p314_205 DO YOU COME FROM MOSCOW
p314_206 HE OR SHE WILL OVERSEE THE LEADERSHIP CONTEST
p314_234 OF FURTHER PRIVACY HE HAD NO NEED
p314_244 I DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWER FOR THEM
p314_246 HOWEVER CIVIL RIGHTS CAMPAIGNERS WELCOMED THE RULING
p314_252 A SCOTTISH FILM STUDIO IS ALSO BEING CONSIDERED
p314_256 IT NEEDS TO BE SORTED OUT BY EASTER
p314_258 HE HAS ALREADY RECEIVED THE FREEDOM OF ABERDEEN
p314_259 I THOUGHT THAT ALL MUSICIANS WERE THE SAME
p314_260 I AM DEEPLY SORRY THEY DID
p314_262 ASYLUM SEEKERS ARE STILL BEING ATTACKED AND ABUSED
p314_264 HE IS YOUNG BUT NOT TOO YOUNG
p314_267 HE WAS MY BIG BROTHER MY FATHER MY GRANDFATHER
p314_269 THEY'VE BEEN AT IT FOR FIVE HOURS
p314_275 HE HAS LOST CONFIDENCE AND WEIGHT
p314_276 INTENSIVE CARE HAS BEEN VERY BUSY
p314_280 THIS IS MY HOME TOWN
p314_287 THE FIRST EVICTION TAKES PLACE ON SUNDAY
p314_291 THERE IS GREAT DEMAND FOR HUMAN CLONING
p314_294 I DON'T THINK WE COULD HAVE EXPECTED BETTER
p314_300 A STATEMENT IS EXPECTED IN APRIL
p314_302 CELTIC CONNECTIONS IS HERE AGAIN - AND THE GREAT DEBATE
p314_303 HE IS ALSO A GREAT FINISHER
p314_307 HE'S BEEN HERE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS
p314_314 WE ARE WAITING FOR THEM TO CALM DOWN
p314_322 HE WASN'T READY TO COPE WITH THE PRESSURES
p314_325 DIALOGUE IS THE KEY
p314_329 MOTHERWELL HAVE NO SUCH GOOD FORTUNE
p314_330 BUT HE IS REVELLING IN THE BIG STAGE
p314_331 YOU HAVE TO THINK NOT
p314_342 HIS JOB WAS NOT ADVERTISED
p314_347 THEY ARE THE HEROES
p314_352 THEIR CONDITION WAS DESCRIBED AS STABLE YESTERDAY
p314_367 FILTERING THROUGH THIS MATERIAL A COMPOSITE FINALLY EMERGES
p314_386 I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT HAS HAPPENED
p314_389 AT THIS LEVEL YOU HAVE ALL TO PERFORM WELL
p314_393 THERE MUST BE BOUNDARIES
p314_398 THE CONCLUSION IS ENTHRALLING
p314_399 INSTEAD IT IS BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD
p314_407 THE REVIEW HAS BEEN CONDUCTED FAIRLY
p314_408 THERE IS NO SMOKING GUN
p314_411 HE IS VERY POPULAR IN THE SQUAD IN ENGLAND AND ABROAD
p314_413 WHETHER THIS RETURN WAS TOO SOON
p314_415 JACKSON MAY WELL BE RIGHT
p314_417 THEY WILL RUN IN TANDEM WITH NEW WORK
p314_418 AS FOR OWEN CLASS IS PERMANENT
p314_421 HE IS NOT VERY BIG EITHER
p316_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p316_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p316_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p316_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p316_027 HAVE WE TRIED EVERYTHING
p316_031 NATURALLY SHE SAID YES
p316_043 WE ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE
p316_044 THE QUESTION IS WILL IT BE ENOUGH
p316_045 AFTER THAT IT IS UP TO THE BOSS
p316_053 THAT IS NOT THE CASE THIS TIME
p316_063 HE SAID IT WAS FOR SALE
p316_083 WORSE STILL HE MIGHT BE SINGING LADY IN RED
p316_088 I FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT THE OUTCOME
p316_089 THE DRIVER ESCAPED INJURY
p316_092 TODAY SHE HAS BEEN RELEASED
p316_103 WE HAD TO PUSH TO GET A GOAL
p316_112 IT HAS UNTIL SATURDAY
p316_120 IT'S GREAT NEWS ISN'T IT
p316_121 IT'S VERY INGENIOUS
p316_124 THE TWO SETS ARE DIFFERENT
p316_128 THE TIME IS UP FOR IRAQ TO COMPLY
p316_135 IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ARGUE WITH THAT
p316_140 AND SO THE CYCLE CONTINUES
p316_141 I DON'T HAVE MANY FRIENDS
p316_145 ALL WILL BE REVEALED IN DUE COURSE
p316_147 AND FRANKLY IT'S BEEN A WHILE
p316_153 WE WERE NOT CONSULTED REGARDING THIS APPOINTMENT
p316_155 THINGS BEGIN TO SPRING TO LIFE
p316_156 OR WAS IT SOME KIND OF A HAM
p316_168 THAT HAPPENS IN BOXING
p316_172 THEY MUST NOT SUCCEED
p316_175 I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM LIKE THAT
p316_184 ACTUALLY IT'S AN AMAZING ORCHESTRA
p316_185 THAT IN A WAY IS THE POINT
p316_186 WHAT IS SO UNUSUAL ABOUT THIS CASE
p316_195 WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED
p316_197 IT IS NOT JUST THE AGENCIES
p316_202 NOBODY IS PUSHING OUT TO THE RIGHT
p316_204 HE CONFIRMED HIS FITNESS
p316_207 BOTH MEN WERE UNINJURED
p316_208 MY HUSBAND WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE
p316_211 WE HAVE A BUDGET IN MARCH
p316_212 THERE WAS NO RESPITE
p316_213 I GOT VERY VERY TIRED
p316_222 LOOK AT A COMPUTER
p316_224 FIRST THE PROGRAMME WAS UNBALANCED
p316_226 HOWEVER IT PROVED TO BE THE TURNING POINT
p316_235 WE ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM
p316_263 IN THE MEANTIME EVERYONE IS TAKING EVERYONE TO COURT
p316_269 THIS IS A GOOD MOVE FOR ME
p316_270 FEEL THE HEAT
p316_273 I BEGAN TO PRAY
p316_277 AND HE HAS A TALE TO TELL
p316_281 IT'S ALL A PART OF LETTING IT GO
p316_285 WE'VE GOT THE BRONZE
p316_286 THEY USE THEM FOR EVERYTHING
p316_298 I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT FOR BONNIE
p316_299 I AM QUITE EXCITED ABOUT IT
p316_307 LET'S GET TO KNOW HIM
p316_319 EVERYONE IN BRITAIN IS PROUD OF THIS TEAM
p316_321 I READ ABOUT IT IN THE NEWSPAPERS
p316_330 BUT WE WILL NOT BE SCARED
p316_333 IT IS THE WEALTHIEST IN EUROPE
p316_334 HE IS ON THE WRONG SIDE
p316_342 ONLY NEW ZEALAND HAS SEEN A SIMILAR INCREASE
p316_345 IT WAS EXTREMELY COLD
p316_347 PEOPLE ARE USING IT IN THEIR DAILY LIVES
p316_358 SOUTER WILL BE BACK
p316_362 IF HE DOES NOT LEAVE HE WILL BE SHOT
p316_364 FISHERMEN ARE STILL IN A STATE OF CONFUSION
p316_368 IT WASN'T AN EASY DECISION
p316_370 THERE IS A CHANGING OF THE GUARD
p316_378 ALI WAS SHOT AT BUT REFUSED TO BACK DOWN
p316_379 HOWEVER WE LET THEM BACK INTO THE GAME
p316_380 I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN ANNABELLE
p316_381 IS THAT SUCH A BAD THING
p316_386 I COULDN'T GET OUT OF BED
p316_388 I'M DELIGHTED AND THE PLAYERS WERE BRILLIANT
p316_389 I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT
p316_391 BUT WHAT WILL WE PUT ON IT
p316_392 IT WILL BENEFIT A LOT OF PEOPLE
p316_395 THAT IS NOT TOO BAD
p316_404 MR FORRESTER REACTED ANGRILY
p316_407 THE WHOLE MATTER IS SOMEWHAT IN THE AIR
p316_415 I HOPE YOU DON'T REGRET IT
p317_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p317_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p317_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p317_026 THERE WAS A FINE LINE TO TREAD
p317_032 THE COUNTRY IS IN A STATE OF CHAOS
p317_036 IT WAS A POLICY THEY WERE AGAINST
p317_043 HAD SHE ENJOYED THE EXPERIENCE
p317_049 THERE IS NO MANDATE FOR A REGIME CHANGE
p317_052 ARE WE GOING TO STAY UP
p317_054 I AM GOING HOME TO SEE MY CHILDREN
p317_062 THIS WASN'T JUST A BIG CROWD
p317_065 THEY ARE THE PARTNER OF CHOICE FOR ANYONE
p317_066 DONALD DEWAR WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT HIS POLITICS
p317_074 WE DON'T KNOW MUCH BUT WE ARE STILL AWAITING NEWS
p317_079 I PLAYED WELL BUT MISSED A FEW CHANCES
p317_085 MCNAUGHTON WAS NOT SO SURE
p317_093 BUT THEY MUST SERVE THEIR SENTENCE IN SCOTLAND
p317_100 BUT DON'T WORRY JUST YET
p317_104 IF SO HOW DOES IT INTEND TO ACHIEVE THIS RESULT
p317_108 THEY INCLUDED CERTAIN INSURANCE POLICIES AND HIS SHARE OF THE HOUSE
p317_111 THIS IS THE BIG ONE
p317_114 THE WORKING FAMILIES TAX CREDIT IS FAR BETTER
p317_116 THEN AS WE KNOW TOO WELL ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN
p317_118 PLAYERS WERE HELD IN EQUALLY LOW REGARD
p317_119 I WAS IN THE TRAIN STATION OVERNIGHT
p317_121 NOW WE NEED TO KEEP OUR HEADS UP
p317_124 THERE WAS NO CONFUSION OVER THE SECOND
p317_129 YOU WOULD BE WRONG
p317_136 THESE SERVICES MAY ALSO HAVE TO BE CUT
p317_142 WE ARE SO SO LUCKY SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED
p317_151 THE DRIVER ESCAPED INJURY
p317_157 SOME REALISM WAS NEEDED ABOUT TIME RESOURCES AND MANAGEMENT
p317_167 I TRY TO BE OPEN TO EXPERIENCE
p317_170 IT IS NO PLACE FOR A POET
p317_178 A LOT OF THINGS CAN GO WRONG
p317_179 I WAS DELIGHTED WITH ROBBIE
p317_188 THIS IS NOT A BIRTHDAY PARTY
p317_189 THIS MAKES NO SENSE
p317_194 THAT OPTION CANNOT BE RULED OUT
p317_198 THREE YEARS PROBATION IS JUST A JOKE
p317_210 I COULD HARDLY KEEP UP WITH PROFESSOR MCKEAN
p317_214 SHE DIED IN MIDDLE AGE
p317_215 THEY DO THE WORK YOU KNOW
p317_216 THERE WILL BE PLENTY TO KEEP THEM OCCUPIED
p317_218 WE WERE A LOAD OF RUBBISH
p317_221 OTHER PEOPLE ALSO TRIED
p317_225 I CAN'T DENY THAT FACT
p317_226 CLUBS CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH
p317_228 SEAMAN IS NOT THE GOALKEEPER OF OLD
p317_229 IT WOULD HAVE VERY LITTLE IMPACT ON THEM
p317_231 BUT IN THE END HE DID - AND BLEW HIM AWAY
p317_255 HE WILL DO SO TODAY IN MONTE CARLO
p317_259 WE HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN DEREK
p317_263 IF ONLY THE PROBLEMS CONCERNED THE PLAYERS
p317_266 THERE WERE NO PROPOSALS ON THE TABLE
p317_267 I HAVE SPOKEN TO HEAD OFFICE
p317_268 HERE THE NATIONAL GALLERY HAS BEEN VERY CLEVER
p317_269 DO YOU WANT A CUP OF TEA
p317_271 WE HAVE ALL BEEN SHOCKED BY HER DEATH
p317_273 WE ARE COMMITTED TO URGENT ACTION
p317_276 LAST YEAR'S WINNER WAS SERGIO GARCIA
p317_278 THE BOOKIES HAVE GOT IT ABOUT RIGHT
p317_300 THIS IS THE START OF A NEW CAMPAIGN
p317_309 NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS EVER WON THIS TOURNAMENT
p317_316 I WAS IN THE ZONE IN THE MORNING
p317_324 THE ORCHESTRA IS QUITE GOOD BUT THE HALL IS TERRIBLE
p317_330 IT WASN'T A FLASHY PERFORMANCE IT WAS VERY WORKMANLIKE
p317_331 IT IS STILL WITH MINISTERS
p317_342 THEY WERE AVERAGE APART TOGETHER SUPERB
p317_344 THIS ISN'T A BETRAYAL OF PUBLIC SERVICES IT'S THEIR RENEWAL
p317_350 THIS COMES DOWN TO A PROBLEM OF ARROGANCE
p317_355 WHAT'S A BOY TO DO
p317_358 THEY SHOULD BE SWEPT AWAY
p317_361 WE WANT TO REPLICATE THAT SUCCESS
p317_366 WE COULD EASILY BE CUT AGAIN
p317_370 SOMEONE ELSE CAN DO THE COOKING THAT NIGHT
p317_372 IT BROKE UP MY MARRIAGE
p317_384 TWO YEARS AGO THE COMMISSION DID NOT WANT TO GET INVOLVED
p317_394 THE COMMITTEES ARE DUE TO REPORT NEXT YEAR
p317_395 IT'S A LONG-TERM SOLUTION
p317_396 THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE CABINET HAS TO ENDORSE
p317_398 HE TAKES HIS TIME AND WON'T BE RUSHED
p317_401 THE DEADLINE FOR SELECTING THE ELECTORS IS TODAY
p317_408 THAT'S THE LAW OF THE LAND
p317_415 THE FIGURES ARE BAD BUT NOT THAT BAD
p318_001 PLEASE CALL STELLA
p318_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p318_016 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM THE EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
p318_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p318_027 THIS YEAR IT WILL BE BILLY CRYSTAL
p318_029 HOWEVER IT'S GOOD TO TURN THE PAGE
p318_030 WE HAVE TO PUT THIS BEHIND US
p318_042 THAT THOUGH WAS JUST THE START OF IT
p318_049 HE WAS CRITICALLY ILL IN HOSPITAL LAST NIGHT
p318_050 MY BROTHER IS BURIED UNDER THERE
p318_052 WHAT WERE THEY
p318_060 IT IS NOT A STANDING ARMY
p318_064 I LEARNED A LOT FROM THAT
p318_067 SANDY WAS VERY ACTIVE
p318_068 HOWEVER THERE IS GREAT POTENTIAL IN THIS RIGHT
p318_073 IT REALLY HAS LEFT THE TOWN IN SHOCK
p318_075 I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT THE ROADS
p318_077 HE WAS CONVICTED AT GLASGOW SHERIFF COURT
p318_080 DID THEY GIVE ANY GOOD ADVICE
p318_094 IT WAS FORCED TO DIVERT
p318_098 PETER DOESN'T WANT TO LEAVE
p318_105 THE QUALITY OF WORK IS VERY IMPRESSIVE
p318_123 THERE IS A GREAT CARRY OVER VALUE
p318_129 RAYMOND WAS ALWAYS ON THE OUTSIDE
p318_138 RECEIVING THIS MEDAL IS AN HONOUR
p318_140 BUT EVERY TWO MINUTES IT WAS EXPLODING
p318_145 HOWEVER IT IS NOT ALL BAD NEWS FOR WOMEN
p318_148 A REVIEW OF THE DECISION IS BEING SOUGHT
p318_155 I LIKE AN IDIOT AGREED
p318_157 I AM NOT BLAMING AUDIENCES
p318_160 HE HAD NEVER RUN THE DISTANCE BEFORE
p318_163 IT WAS A FIERY GAME
p318_164 AGENTS AND COACHES MUST BE PAID
p318_165 GOLF IS A GAME OF HONOUR AND ETHICS
p318_171 THE MINISTERS ARE NOW TO MAKE THEIR DECISION
p318_175 IT WAS THAT KIND OF NIGHT
p318_180 WE WON'T DO THAT
p318_182 FROM NOW ON THERE IS NO HIDING PLACE
p318_183 I DIDN'T WANT TO IGNORE THE PUNTERS
p318_184 HE QUIT IN OCTOBER
p318_187 HER DAUGHTER IS GETTING MARRIED
p318_190 PATIENTS WILL BE PARTNERS IN DECISION MAKING
p318_194 THAT WILL DEPEND ON THE OUTCOME OF INQUIRIES
p318_196 AFTER THAT THOUGH WE ARE STILL WAITING TO SEE
p318_198 THIS IS A REALLY SERIOUS ISSUE
p318_200 HOW DO WE GET MORE PEOPLE IN
p318_204 ELECTION RESULTS ARE EXPECTED SOON
p318_208 IT WAS GOOD TO SCORE THE GOAL TODAY
p318_209 THE NIGHT IS YOUNG
p318_221 IT SOUNDS LIKE AN APPALLING TRAGIC INCIDENT
p318_235 MY BODY IS EXHAUSTED
p318_236 HOME IS IN THE SCOTTISH BORDERS
p318_242 I TRIED TO PUSH HIM AWAY
p318_253 IT IS A MEMORIAL
p318_256 THE REASON IS PARTLY BECAUSE OF TRADITION
p318_261 HE WAS IN CONTENTION ALMOST EVERY WEEK
p318_264 WE ARE PLAYING THEM AT THEIR OWN GAME
p318_273 THERE IS NO MORE MONEY
p318_274 MY MOTHER IS A WIDOW
p318_275 THE RUBBLE WAS RIGHT UP TO THE CEILING
p318_294 THAT THOUGH IS TO MISS THE POINT
p318_297 WHAT'S THE POINT OF STAYING SOBER
p318_304 I AM NOT A FAN OF BOOKS
p318_309 I FIND THIS ONGOING DEBATE IS DEMEANING
p318_318 THAT IS THE POSITION THE MOD HAS ADOPTED
p318_323 AS IF THEY EVER STOPPED
p318_328 IT WENT ON TO BECOME AN ANNUAL EVENT
p318_331 EVERYONE IS TOO UPSET TO COMMENT
p318_342 WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT THIS IS A JOB
p318_343 IT'S NO LESS INTRIGUING HOWEVER
p318_348 ON REFLECTION IT WAS REALLY QUITE EXCITING
p318_351 THAT MIGHT HELP A BIT
p318_368 HE SUFFERED A BROKEN BACK AND OTHER INJURIES
p318_370 THE HEARING WAS FAIR
p318_383 IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME ISN'T IT
p318_385 WE COULD LEARN A LOT FROM THEM
p318_387 SURE WE HAVE PROBLEMS
p318_391 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES
p318_392 WE ALSO ENJOYED A LOT OF SUPPORT
p318_398 HE SAYS IT OFTEN ENOUGH
p318_400 HIS PRIMARY RESIDENCE IS SCOTLAND
p318_405 THE OPEN CHAMPION IS BACK
p318_408 I WANT TO KEEP HIM
p318_417 SIGHTINGS WERE REPLACED BY RUMOURS
p318_419 I DIDN'T PLAY ALL THAT WELL
p323_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p323_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p323_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p323_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p323_031 ITS ROLE IS NOT TO INTERFERE
p323_032 LEISURE CENTRES WERE ALSO AFFECTED
p323_033 SOMETHING HAPPENED ON THAT ISLAND
p323_043 NOW THEY HAVE FOUND OUT THE TRUTH
p323_047 WE HAVE OUR SUPPORTERS AND OUR ENEMIES
p323_048 MACKIE WAS AT HOME UNABLE TO WATCH
p323_050 WE HAVE BEEN LET DOWN BY THESE PEOPLE
p323_060 I THINK THAT'S A BIT OF AN INVASION
p323_061 IT IS VERY DIFFICULT
p323_064 THEN THEY KILLED ANOTHER THREE
p323_067 MOST OF THE OTHERS WERE IN THEIR TWENTIES
p323_070 THEY ARE NOT THE ANSWER TO STAFF SHORTAGES
p323_072 ADVICE AND COUNSELLING WILL BE OFFERED
p323_079 THE PUNISHMENT WAS SWIFT
p323_085 ARE YOU UP FOR BUSINESS
p323_087 WHO DOES HE THINK WILL WIN
p323_089 AN ANNOUNCEMENT WILL FOLLOW IN DUE COURSE
p323_095 JACQUES CHIRAC THE FRENCH PRESIDENT WAS SURELY IN HIS SIGHTS
p323_096 THERE IS NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST
p323_103 HE COULD LOOK AFTER HIMSELF BUT DIDN'T
p323_104 THE DECISION WAS DESIGNED TO SHOCK INVESTORS
p323_107 IT'S UP TO THEIR PARENTS TO CHOOSE
p323_113 I HAVE PLAYED REALLY WELL ALL YEAR
p323_118 IF IT DOES IT MEANS HE HAS FAILED
p323_120 WE HAVE A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT
p323_122 HOWEVER THE MOVE WAS BITTERLY CRITICISED LAST NIGHT
p323_128 HE PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE ADDED MAINLY BY ME
p323_129 LORD SAINSBURY IS NOT A NEWCOMER
p323_141 WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR JOB
p323_145 IT ALSO CALLS FOR LICENSING OF COLLECTION CENTRES
p323_166 THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE TO THANK
p323_168 I WANT MY COUNTRY TO BE A REPUBLIC NOT AN EMPIRE
p323_174 MICHAEL IS PUTTING ON A BRAVE FACE
p323_183 THEY PREFER THE SHORT INTENSIVE SESSION
p323_185 HE ACCUSED THE PRIME MINISTER OF DITHERING
p323_187 WITHOUT APPROVAL THE SPORT WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP
p323_195 LAW ABIDING MOTORISTS HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR
p323_196 WE WORK FOR THE ATHLETE
p323_197 IT WAS A GOOD ATMOSPHERE
p323_199 IT WAS AN ACCOUNTING ERROR
p323_204 WE BEGIN AS EVER WITH A REMINDER OF THE END
p323_207 HE IS FIRM BUT INCLUSIVE AND VERY FAIR
p323_208 POST OFFICES ARE CLOSING NOW
p323_210 PEOPLE LOVE TO SEE THIS STUFF
p323_211 ONE FILM A YEAR IS HE SAYS HIS NATURAL RHYTHM
p323_217 I HAVE NO PLANS TO CHANGE THE OATH
p323_219 WE HAD A HUGE RESPONSE TO THAT CAMPAIGN
p323_233 HE IS INDEED THE GRANDSON OF TRAVELLING FOLK
p323_251 MAYBE THEY WILL SHOW IT NEXT YEAR
p323_254 EVERYTHING IS UP FOR GRABS
p323_259 HE SAID TO ME WHICH ONE SON
p323_263 IT IS HAVING A BIG IMPACT
p323_269 THE SAME GOES FOR RUSSIA
p323_271 IT IS NOT GREAT ART
p323_280 HAVE A LOOK AT OUR ACCOUNTS
p323_285 WE ALSO HAVE TO WORK THE DARK SIDE IF YOU WILL
p323_289 CERTAINLY THERE IS MUCH ON THE AGENDA
p323_291 HE WAS JUST AWESOME
p323_300 AND SHE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE ANNIKA IS BETTER
p323_304 HOW GOOD IS LENNOX LEWIS
p323_316 THE COUNCIL'S CONCERN IS VERY SIMPLE
p323_318 THIS RULE IS ARCHAIC
p323_324 SHE IS AN EXPERT ON MEDICAL ETHICS
p323_325 THEN THERE IS THE TERRAIN
p323_326 WE WILL DEAL WITH THE REFUGEES
p323_339 ANGOLA WAS A REALLY HARD PLACE
p323_342 EVERYONE THOUGHT THEY WERE SAFE
p323_345 THAT'S WHY THE YOUNG MUSICIANS HAVE JOINED
p323_352 I'M TRYING TO STAY OPEN ON THAT
p323_362 MEXICO CITY WAS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE
p323_374 THE ANSWER IS MAYHEM
p323_382 THAT WILL BE THE SWEETNESS
p323_384 THE IDEA HAS POTENTIAL FOR THE FUTURE
p323_392 THIS DOES NOT CREATE ANY PRECEDENT
p323_394 I WANT TO GO HOME
p323_401 FIVE OFFICERS WERE INJURED
p323_405 THE HOUSE WAS FULL OF SMOKE
p323_407 THE EARLY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS HE DID NOT
p323_412 LAST NIGHT THE ROW CONTINUED
p323_418 WE TEND TO COME GOOD AT THE END
p323_421 AS OFTEN AS NOT THE CAUSE REMAINS A MYSTERY
p326_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p326_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p326_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p326_025 JIMMY RETURNED TO ABERDEEN BUT SHE REMAINED WITH GEORGE
p326_028 IT IS BELIEVED HE HAD BEEN STABBED
p326_030 I SAW THE OTHER CAR COMING BUT COULD DO NOTHING
p326_033 ROY KEANE IS CERTAINLY THE BEST
p326_038 SHE DIDN'T TELL US ANYTHING NEW
p326_039 THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THIS BACK HOME
p326_042 WE JUST LOVE TO CHAT
p326_044 WHAT DID THEY THINK OF HER VOICE
p326_059 THIS IS ALL PART OF OPENING THE DOOR
p326_068 EVERYONE COULD SEE IT APART FROM KEVIN KEEGAN
p326_071 THE SUCCESS STORY SHOWS NO SIGNS OF STOPPING
p326_074 MORE PATIENCE AND COMPOSURE WAS REQUIRED
p326_078 WE'RE STILL IN TALKS AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL CONTINUE
p326_079 I AM IMMENSELY PROUD OF THEM
p326_087 I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S TRUE
p326_096 WE ARE VERY VERY PROUD OF ALAIN
p326_098 IT WAS EXACTLY FOUR MONTHS AWAY
p326_108 I JUST SAW THEM FOR A FEW MINUTES
p326_119 SHE HAS NOW BEEN REGISTERED AS DISABLED
p326_128 HIS FATHER AND MOTHER ARE IN FILM PRODUCTION
p326_145 FOR A MOMENT IT WAS ALL ABOUT HER
p326_150 YET IT DOES NOT LOSE APPEAL
p326_155 THE MAIN THING IS THAT THEY ENJOY IT
p326_156 IT IS WORSE BECAUSE SHE SUFFERS FROM ANGINA
p326_157 I FELT HE WAS EXCELLENT
p326_159 THIS MEETING IS THE PATH TO SALVATION
p326_161 SHE WANTED TO MOVE
p326_166 THERE IS NO INTERNAL DAMAGE
p326_172 THAT HOWEVER CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY CONSTANT INVESTMENT
p326_180 THAT WAS MERELY THEIR INITIAL PROBLEM
p326_186 HE WAS ALL BLACKENED
p326_187 THIS IS YOUR COUNTRY
p326_189 THE FUND HAS THREE ELEMENTS
p326_196 IT'S NOT EVEN FINISHED
p326_211 YES IT GAVE ME A LOT OF CONFIDENCE
p326_213 AFTER THAT HE BECAME MORE ROMANTIC
p326_214 IT'S NOT LONG ENOUGH
p326_216 YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE AWAY MY LIFE
p326_218 THEY FINISHED SECOND AND THIRD
p326_221 IT HAD NOT BEEN A TERRIBLY INSPIRING END EITHER
p326_222 I'M WONDERING WHAT YOU FEEL ABOUT THE YOUNGEST
p326_223 SHE DID NOT ATTEND THE COURTROOM
p326_231 THEY MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US
p326_232 WELL THERE IS A BED
p326_242 THE VACANCIES ARE IN SUPPORT SERVICES AND ARTS
p326_244 HIS SISTER ADDED WE EXPECTED HIM TO BE JAILED
p326_248 I ENJOY PLAYING WITH BOTH OF THEM
p326_251 I TEND NOT TO LOOK BACK
p326_261 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF
p326_276 HE MADE NO BIG MISTAKES
p326_278 WHICH IS A SHAME
p326_280 THERE HAS BEEN NO COVER-UP - JUST THE OPPOSITE IN FACT
p326_285 IN SHORT THE SCOTTISH EXCESS IS NOT DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY
p326_293 WE HAVE TO ADAPT TO THIS LEVEL
p326_296 INCLUSION AND AUTISM IS IT WORKING
p326_301 ENGLISH IS THE LANGUAGE OF POP MUSIC
p326_313 THEY SHOULD USE IT ON THE CATWALK
p326_315 WE'RE LOOKING AT THE CITIZENS THEATRE THE LYCEUM
p326_319 THEY TREATED ME WITH RESPECT AND COURTESY
p326_322 A CEASEFIRE IS A CEASEFIRE IS A CEASEFIRE
p326_325 YOU SEE MY BACK HAS GONE
p326_332 NATO HAS COMPLETED PLANNING FOR AIR STRIKES
p326_336 I'M SURE THAT CLUBS WILL ALL BE DELIGHTED
p326_341 IT WOULD BE A MASSIVE BOOST FOR THEM
p326_344 THE THEN SECRETARY WAS NOT AMUSED
p326_346 IT IS ALSO CLAIMED THAT HE WAS MURDERED
p326_348 I CAN'T SEE HIM REVERSING THAT
p326_357 MY HUSBAND WAS BORN IN ZIMBABWE
p326_362 THE MIX WITH TIGER IS PERFECT
p326_366 FINALLY ACTION HAD BEEN TAKEN
p326_369 BROKE DOWN AND CAN'T BE FIXED
p326_374 IT IS PATENTLY TRUE
p326_375 THEY DID NOT THREATEN ANYONE
p326_378 BUT SOMETIMES IT WORKS OUT ALL RIGHT
p326_381 THEREIN LIES THE PROBLEM
p326_385 I HAVE TO KEEP WORKING HARD
p326_392 SHE SAID SHE WOULD NOT WELCOME THE FLOWERS
p329_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p329_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p329_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
p329_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p329_026 THIS COULD BE ONE SUCH CASE HE DECLARED
p329_030 THAT THEIR MUSIC IS TRULY TRULY TRULY GREAT
p329_034 WE DON'T KNOW THE SCALE OF NEED
p329_040 WE KNOW YOU WILL NOT LET US DOWN
p329_042 THERE ARE BIG NAMES
p329_043 THAT ARGUMENT HAS BEEN WON
p329_045 I HOPE YOU WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT
p329_049 THEY SAID SHE HAD BEEN VISITING HER SON WHO IS UNEMPLOYED
p329_069 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE FUNDING IS EXHAUSTED
p329_071 EUROPE HAS LOST ITS WAY UNDER THE SOCIALISTS
p329_073 HE WOULD BE WITH HIS PEERS
p329_074 THEY SEEM TO BE BACKING OFF FROM THAT
p329_075 THIS WILL BE NO EASY OPTION
p329_077 I AM SO SORRY
p329_078 THIS AVALANCHE IS JUST BEGINNING
p329_081 I WAS THERE FOR FIVE HOURS
p329_089 IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND VERY WORRYING
p329_091 I CANNOT SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE IRA
p329_092 HIS TREATMENT HAS BEEN QUITE ATROCIOUS
p329_093 I WANT TO PLAY AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL
p329_096 JAMMING WOULD BE EQUALLY DIFFICULT
p329_102 THERE IS NO GUARANTEE
p329_108 IT MAY BE ARGUED
p329_117 THE EVENT HAS NOW GONE TO HELSINKI
p329_122 DAVID WAS NOT EITHER
p329_128 THE TRIAL IS SET FOR FEBRUARY
p329_137 I FELT UNDER NO PRESSURE TODAY
p329_147 BUT EVEN SO YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TRY SOMETHING NEW
p329_155 I GUESS IT IS DOWN TO FOCUS
p329_157 I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR ALL MY PLAYERS
p329_158 HIS TRACK RECORD IS NOT PROMISING
p329_159 NO-ONE NOT EVEN THE SCOTTISH ARTS COUNCIL WAS INTERESTED IN HER
p329_164 WHAT IF THE CONFESSION IS AFTER ALL A FAKE
p329_175 IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY
p329_189 I THINK IT'S AWFUL
p329_199 I HAVE A THEORY
p329_200 BUT THESE WERE THE NIGHTS
p329_218 A QUALITY AUDIT OFFICER HAS ALSO BEEN APPOINTED
p329_219 WE FIND THIS VERY SAD
p329_221 BUT IT OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T SO THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO INTERVENE
p329_224 IT IS A STEP ON THE WAY
p329_229 IT'S A DIFFICULT JOB
p329_232 THIS REPRESENTS A TOUGH GAME FOR US
p329_239 IT WILL BE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TOMORROW
p329_241 I WAS HAPPIEST WITH MY SHORT GAME
p329_242 I LEAVE TONIGHT FOR ENGLAND
p329_246 I'M DELIGHTED WITH HOW HE HAS COME THROUGH
p329_248 WE CERTAINLY DID ENOUGH TO WIN IT BUT DIDN'T
p329_249 WE TOLD THEM IN AUGUST
p329_251 THAT IS MY ROLE
p329_258 IN THE EVENT IT PROVED A LARGELY UPLIFTING EXPERIENCE
p329_270 THERE WAS A BATTLE THERE
p329_272 TODAY'S RULING CONFIRMS THAT FACT
p329_273 IT'S GOOD NEWS AND LONG OVERDUE
p329_277 HE DOESN'T DO DINNER
p329_283 WE ARE TAKING IT SERIOUSLY
p329_285 MAYBE THIS BATTLE HAS BEEN
p329_286 THE MANAGER IS THERE TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS
p329_291 HIS FATHER AND MOTHER ARE IN FILM PRODUCTION
p329_298 THIS IS NOT A FACELESS SYSTEM
p329_300 IN ALL CASES COMPUTER EQUIPMENT WAS SEIZED
p329_305 BOTH AGREED ON THE SUCCESS OF THE EVENT
p329_308 CLEARLY THAT IS IMPORTANT IN NURSING
p329_310 THE CAMPAIGN WAS RAUCOUS
p329_313 WE WERE IN DIFFERENT PLACES USUALLY IN CELLARS
p329_324 THE SOUTH AFRICAN DEFENDED HIS WORK ETHIC
p329_340 IT IS NOW TIME FOR JUSTICE
p329_345 BRIAN WILSON IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW IS A GENIUS
p329_351 IT WAS QUITE RIGOROUS
p329_354 THEIR MIND WAS ALREADY MADE UP
p329_356 WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY SURPLUS
p329_365 WE HAVE BEEN PREPARING ALL YEAR
p329_366 THE POSITION ON THE EURO REMAINS UNCHANGED
p329_367 SO WHAT DOES ONE DO
p329_374 BUT WE COULD NOT CHANGE HIS MIND
p329_379 LAST YEAR HOWEVER IT WAS DECIDED TO DISSOLVE THE ABBEY
p329_391 I'M HAPPY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THAT
p329_396 OFFERED THE GOLD MEDAL HE DECLINED
p329_401 WE ARE NOW OPEN
p329_405 THEY'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE
p329_417 IT IS SO ELUSIVE AND LIGHT
p330_004 WE ALSO NEED A SMALL PLASTIC SNAKE AND A BIG TOY FROG FOR THE KIDS
p330_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p330_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
p330_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p330_016 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
p330_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p330_026 I WAS BACKING HIM UP
p330_029 THAT WAS THEIR ATTITUDE
p330_033 AND IT HAD TWO SEATS
p330_034 THEY COULD MOVE IN AT ANY MOMENT
p330_039 OR SO SHE THOUGHT
p330_046 THEY SAID WE WERE OUT OF TOUCH
p330_047 IN THE MEANTIME THE FANS WOULD SETTLE FOR A DERBY WIN
p330_048 IT IS BAD NEWS FOR THE FLOODED AREAS
p330_053 I WAS NEVER GOING TO PLAY AGAINST SCOTLAND
p330_059 YESTERDAY MR HAGUE DISMISSED THE POLL
p330_064 ONE THE ACUTE SERVICES TRUST WILL RUN THE GENERAL HOSPITAL SERVICES
p330_068 I THINK IT IS A RELEASE OF TENSION
p330_071 IT IS ALSO VERY VALUABLE
p330_074 THIS MAKES UP FOR IT
p330_079 I COULD DO A BETTER JOB
p330_082 I AM HERE TO PLAY FOOTBALL
p330_087 IT WAS AN EASY DECISION TO COME HERE
p330_088 I DIDN'T KNOW THE COMPANY ALL THAT WELL OR THE DANCERS
p330_092 EVERYTHING WILL FALL INTO PLACE IT SHOULD BE FINE
p330_093 THIS WILL BE GREAT FOR THE YOUNG LADS
p330_095 WHO SAID IMPATIENCE IS A VIRTUE
p330_109 GERHARD SCHROEDER WAS THE VICTOR
p330_122 SOME PEOPLE STILL THINK SHE SHOULD BE ENGLISH
p330_123 MANAGER NEIL COOPER REVEALED YESTERDAY
p330_140 HE WILL BE JUDGED BY HIS ACTIONS
p330_159 I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT
p330_161 WE'RE JUST A FAMILY WORKING HARD WORKING SEVEN DAYS A WEEK
p330_172 AFTER THAT WE MADE SOME CHANGES
p330_183 EURO THE SINGLE CURRENCY IS A FACT
p330_189 A BOARD OF INQUIRY HAS ALREADY BEEN CONVENED
p330_195 THE LUXURY HAS BEEN WELL USED
p330_199 TODAY HOWEVER HALF OF THEM GET THIS FINANCIAL HELP
p330_201 WE THINK ALL OTHER MEASURES ARE NOT EXHAUSTED
p330_203 OUR MESSAGE WAS INCLUSIVE
p330_207 I THINK THE EURO HAS SLIPPED
p330_212 I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE PLUNGE
p330_225 BUT IT'S JUST GREAT TO HAVE WON
p330_229 I'VE GOT NO SECRET
p330_230 WE TALK ABOUT MR MICHAEL JOHNSON AND HE IS AWESOME
p330_236 WILL THEY EVER REOPEN
p330_238 WE HAVE GREAT TEAM SPIRIT
p330_244 THEY SHOULD TAKE THEIR MOBILE PHONES
p330_245 HE LOVED HIS JOB AND WORKING IN NEWSPAPERS
p330_247 THEY ARE ALSO EXPLOITED BY THE MARKETS
p330_251 WE MUST ALL PLAY OUR PART
p330_253 IT WAS TO BE PUBLISHED NEXT MONTH
p330_263 LAST WEEK HE WAS TAKEN INTO HOSPITAL
p330_268 BUT CLEARLY IT IS CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTAND THAT POINT
p330_269 MARY IS AS IT WERE THE CAUSE OF HER MOTHER'S DEATH
p330_271 FOR THIS GOVERNMENT REFORM AND RESOURCES GO TOGETHER
p330_273 HOWEVER MANY OF THEIR VICTORIES HAVE BEEN CLOSE AFFAIRS
p330_274 ALL KINDS OF THINGS OCCUR
p330_275 MENTALLY YOU HAVE TO BE TOUGH
p330_284 EQUITY DECLINED TO COMMENT
p330_287 HE LATER BECAME A RESPECTED HIGH COURT JUDGE
p330_288 THEY WERE BOTH DELIGHTFUL TO WORK WITH
p330_289 IT'S MY DELIGHT ON A SHINY NIGHT
p330_303 IT IS QUITE AN EYE OPENER
p330_310 IT IS EXTREMELY POPULAR WITH FAMILIES
p330_313 THEY ALSO INTEND TO TRAVEL TODAY
p330_314 THERE'S A LOT OF HYSTERIA
p330_323 THE COMMITTEE'S REMIT IS FAR REACHING
p330_331 YET THE DATA IS COMPELLING
p330_352 IT DIDN'T HELP HIM AS FAR AS WE HAD SEEN
p330_353 HEAD INJURIES ARE THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH
p330_354 IT IS PATENTLY TRUE
p330_355 I'VE GOT MY OWN IDEAS
p330_364 THIS WAS ANOTHER VIDEO CASSETTE
p330_369 WE KNOW THEM AS MOBILE TELEPHONES
p330_384 SO PEOPLE WILL COME OUT WITH THESE THINGS
p330_386 I AM NOT A HAPPY MAN
p330_388 THAT WOULD OPEN THE GATES OF HELL
p330_391 HE WAS LOCATED AFTER GOING TO SINGAPORE
p330_400 ALL THE TEACHERS ARE AFGHAN REFUGEES
p330_403 THEY HAD GIVEN UP ON HIM
p330_412 WHAT IS NEXT
p330_416 YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH WHAT YOU'VE GOT
p330_420 BUT IT LOOKS GOOD FOR NEXT YEAR
p330_423 I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT
p333_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p333_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p333_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION
p333_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARC WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p333_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p333_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p333_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p333_017 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
p333_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p333_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p333_027 BUT WHO SHOT THE PRESIDENT
p333_039 HIS VIEWS ARE HARDLY SURPRISING
p333_041 WE HAVE NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT
p333_049 YOU CAN'T GIVE IN TO THE VANDALS
p333_054 MY PARENTS ARE EXHAUSTED
p333_056 THE PERFORMANCE WAS EXCELLENT
p333_057 ALRIGHT IT WAS A DEFEAT BUT IT FELT LIKE A VICTORY
p333_059 IT WILL COME UP HERE
p333_064 IT HAS BEEN BLOWN OUT OF ALL PROPORTION
p333_079 THEN IT WAS THE TURN OF THE CARNIVAL
p333_088 ON FUEL THE CHANCELLOR HAS A NUMBER OF OPTIONS
p333_104 SAFETY WAS ALSO AN ISSUE
p333_105 THAT'S WHY HE VISITED
p333_113 I'M SURPRISED TO HEAR IT FROM TONY
p333_117 THAT LEFT A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH
p333_119 WE MUST IMPROVE OUR RELATIONS WITH GOVERNMENT
p333_121 THIS WAS DISMISSED AS ABSOLUTE NONSENSE
p333_131 I HAVE BEEN COMING HERE FOR NINE YEARS
p333_133 A YOUNG BRITON HAD A LUCKY ESCAPE
p333_142 HOWEVER IT'S GOOD TO TURN THE PAGE
p333_145 THAT IS IMPRESSIVE BY ANY STANDARDS
p333_146 THERE IS NO SIGN OF ANYONE BEING HURT
p333_149 WE ACTUALLY HAVEN'T MANAGED TO MEET DEMAND
p333_150 THE SCOTS ARE GREAT
p333_158 CHRISTIANS IN PAKISTAN ARE TERRIFIED
p333_166 ITS EFFECT ON HUMANS IS NOT YET KNOWN
p333_171 IT IS TRUE BUT IT IS ONLY PART OF THE ISSUE
p333_172 IT'S GOING TO BE EPIC
p333_175 HE JUST CARRIED ON FILMING
p333_179 IT IS A JOB CREATION SCHEME
p333_182 IT'S A FLOURISHING AND BEAUTIFUL CITY
p333_185 THIS AREA IS PERFECT FOR CHILDREN
p333_186 NO THEY HAVE NOT
p333_190 THE WEEKLY AVERAGE WAS THREE HOURS
p333_194 THERE WAS AN ELEMENT OF JEALOUSY
p333_197 I DIDN'T PLAY WELL LAST YEAR
p333_198 EDINBURGH IN FACT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SURVEY
p333_200 NOW IT HAS BEEN ECLIPSED
p333_205 IT HAS COME AS A BOMBSHELL
p333_209 SINGING HAS GONE OUT OF FASHION
p333_211 THEY MUST BE KEPT ON THE GROUND
p333_216 IT SEPARATES THE MEN FROM THE BOYS
p333_218 OR SOME THOUGHT THAT THEY HAVE
p333_219 IF ONLY WE HAD KNOWN
p333_220 THIS PROCESS OF ATTRITION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE
p333_221 A TREASURY SPOKESMAN DERIDED THE TORY CHARGE
p333_230 SHE WILL ALSO GET A PAY RISE
p333_241 THAT IS THE KEY MESSAGE
p333_248 IT IS A WEAKNESS AND NOT THE ONLY ONE
p333_255 BUT THE FOREIGN SECRETARY CAN COPE
p333_257 NOTHING IS BEING OFFERED IN EXCHANGE
p333_260 THE ARROW WAS AIMED AT THE HEART
p333_261 THE NEW DEAL WILL CONSTANTLY BE IMPROVED
p333_263 I HEARD SOME OF HIS REMARKS
p333_266 MARY ARCHER IS ALMOST TOO CLEVER
p333_277 LORD LEVY SAID HE STARTED LIFE WITH NOTHING
p333_297 AND SOONER THAN WE MAY THINK
p333_298 RAISED THE WAY YOU WANT IT
p333_302 A REVIEW OF THE DECISION IS BEING SOUGHT
p333_306 THEY CERTAINLY DO NOT SOCIALISE
p333_319 I WAS DOING WELL AT THE HUSTINGS
p333_323 I'M QUITE EMBARRASSED AND ASHAMED OF DOING THAT
p333_328 AND NOW HE TELLS US
p333_331 THIS PATTON WILL ALSO RETURN
p333_338 THE WINNER WILL BE ANNOUNCED BY EARLY SUMMER
p333_347 FOR NOW WE MUST TAKE ONE GAME AT A TIME
p333_354 SMITH HAS NOT LET HIM DOWN
p333_358 IT HAS BEEN RECORDED TWICE
p333_370 BOTH MANAGEMENTS ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE
p333_372 I'LL GO OUT AND BE AGGRESSIVE
p333_380 ALL OF THE NAMES ARE FAMILIAR TO ME
p333_381 THERE ARE MOMENTS OF HONESTY TOO
p333_385 IT WAS A LOT OF HARD WORK BUT IT WASN'T DIFFICULT
p333_396 MEANWHILE THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT GOES ON
p333_411 IT MAY MEAN MORE MONEY BUT WE DON'T NEED THE MONEY
p334_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p334_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p334_019 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
p334_025 A JUDICIAL REVIEW IS ALSO BEING CONSIDERED
p334_031 IT WAS NO SURPRISE
p334_046 NO MEANINGFUL RESPONSE WAS ISSUED
p334_048 TIMES HAVE CHANGED BUT HAVE THEY IMPROVED
p334_051 LATER WE DISCOVERED IT WAS A HOAX
p334_052 IT IS A FORM OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE
p334_057 IT COULD TAKE THREE DAYS
p334_058 HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE BUILT BY NEXT YEAR
p334_064 HE'S VERY GOOD AT RELATING TO ADULTS
p334_065 HE IS FIRM BUT INCLUSIVE AND VERY FAIR
p334_066 EVERY ASPECT OF OUR PLAY WAS FIRST CLASS
p334_067 EVERY SCHOOL IN SCOTLAND SHOULD BE EXCELLENT
p334_072 WE ARE LOOKING FOR VOLUNTEERS
p334_074 IT WAS VERY PERSONAL AND VERY INTIMATE
p334_085 THEY USE THEM FOR EVERYTHING
p334_089 THE RUBBLE WAS RIGHT UP TO THE CEILING
p334_095 I THOUGHT THEY PLAYED VERY WELL
p334_112 IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG
p334_115 I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THEM TODAY THOUGH
p334_129 WE ARE TAKING ADVICE ON THIS
p334_137 INCLUSION AND AUTISM IS IT WORKING
p334_150 WHY IS THAT
p334_151 IT IS EXTREMELY SAD
p334_156 HE WAS NOT DETERRED
p334_160 THAT IS NOT JUST MY PERSONAL VIEW
p334_164 THAT'S AS IT SHOULD BE
p334_172 THREE PEOPLE WERE PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE SCENE
p334_173 BUT THE PREMIERSHIP IS EVERYTHING TO US
p334_177 THE NEW SYSTEM WILL BE MARKETED THIS SUMMER
p334_192 HOLYROOD IS JUST A PART OF THE JIGSAW
p334_196 HE WILL ADDRESS THE NATION THIS EVENING
p334_200 WE BELIEVE THAT THE REASON IS POVERTY
p334_202 WE WELCOME THIS INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE
p334_203 THE CHILDREN WERE NOT THOUGHT TO BE SO SERIOUSLY HURT
p334_204 I'M TRYING TO STAY OPEN ON THAT
p334_207 THE FRUSTRATION WAS SHOWING
p334_208 SHAKING HIS HEAD MR COOK SAID HE SIMPLY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT
p334_215 SO THE EUROPEAN ELECTIONS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
p334_229 HOWEVER THERE WAS HOPE AND GLORY TOO FOR SCOTLAND
p334_232 TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HE RAN THE SHOW
p334_235 IT'S GOOD FUN AND MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING
p334_238 I NEVER WANTED A LEGAL BATTLE
p334_249 THAT'S WHY THEY GO TO THE OPERA
p334_251 THEY WERE OUTSTANDING AND THOROUGHLY DESERVED THEIR WIN
p334_252 THE TROUBLE IS THOUGHTHERE IS NO SIMPLE SOLUTION
p334_261 HE WAS SENTENCED TO SEVEN YEARS
p334_268 I MAY THINK ABOUT PERFORMING IT
p334_274 YOU CAN'T GO BACK AND CHANGE THINGS
p334_275 WE ARE ON A FOUR-YEAR MISSION
p334_284 ADAMS IS SURELY WORTH A CHANCE
p334_286 THE OPEN CHAMPION IS BACK
p334_294 BY THEN HOWEVER BOTH MEN WERE ALREADY IN THE US
p334_298 PEOPLE ARE FED UP
p334_307 IF THEY DON'T THEY CAN EXPECT THEIR FUNDING TO BE CUT
p334_310 HOWEVER PENSIONS AND SALARIES HAVE YET TO BE SETTLED
p334_315 THE HOTEL WAS NOW FOR SALE
p334_321 I WELCOME THIS NEW SERVICE
p334_322 THEN IT DEVELOPED INTO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL
p334_324 EQUALLY HE IS GRATEFUL TO HAVE SURVIVED THE CULL
p334_326 THE LAW SHOULD BE CHANGED
p334_333 THE ATTACK WAS TOTALLY UNPROVOKED
p334_335 THEY'VE NOT LET ANYONE INTO THE LOOP
p334_340 WHAT DID WE LEARN
p334_344 HE LOVED HIS CHILDREN
p334_347 AN APPEAL WAS MADE TO THE PRESIDING OFFICER
p334_358 THEY'VE GOT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE WAY
p334_359 IT GAVE NO FURTHER DETAILS
p334_363 HER MOTHER SAID SHE DIDN'T LOOK VERY WELL AT ALL
p334_371 JANUARY IS A BAD TIME OF YEAR
p334_373 LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER MAKES THE HASH OF IT
p334_375 THIS IS A HUGE BOOST FOR MY CONFIDENCE
p334_378 HERE WE HAVE NOT HAD ONE HOUR
p334_380 I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH GETTING OLDER
p334_386 THIS FIGHT IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY
p334_389 WOULD YOU TAKE THEM
p334_392 HE WOULD TAKE UP THE BIKE
p334_404 WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE OUR PARTY
p334_408 IT REMAINS IN PUBLIC OWNERSHIP
p334_412 SUB NOT USED MCARTHUR
p334_419 THIS IS A THOROUGHLY HANDSOME AND ENJOYABLE PRODUCTION
p334_422 IT'S NOT REALISTIC BECAUSE IT'S EARLY DAYS
p334_423 IT IS PAR FOR THE COURSE ISN'T IT
p335_001 PLEASE CALL STELLA
p335_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p335_010 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
p335_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
p335_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p335_024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
p335_026 HER CONDITION LAST NIGHT WAS DESCRIBED AS CRITICAL
p335_032 WELL WHAT DO YOU KNOW
p335_033 BUT SHE WAS VERY HUMAN
p335_038 WHO DOES HE THINK WILL WIN
p335_044 THE FAILINGS ARE SERIOUS
p335_054 THE YUGOSLAV ARMY WILL STILL BE THERE
p335_068 I AM DELIGHTED TO HEAR THIS WONDERFUL NEWS
p335_069 IT IS A FAMILY DAY OUT
p335_076 HE HAD A MOUSTACHE
p335_082 ITS WORKFORCE IS TO BE MADE REDUNDANT
p335_087 CORRECTION KNOWING HIM HE MIGHT
p335_089 WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED
p335_092 FIRST AND FOREMOST THE GAME IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
p335_105 WHICH PERHAPS IS JUST AS WELL
p335_117 POLICE WERE ALSO PERPLEXED
p335_119 BRITAIN MAY NOW BE FORCED TO LISTEN
p335_121 THE FINAL STAGE IS PARANOIA
p335_131 THAT'S THE SORT OF GAME YOU WANT
p335_137 I AM PREPARED TO HELP MAKE IT HAPPEN
p335_138 THIS IS NOT PRESENTLY THE CASE
p335_145 IT'S TOO BIG A RISK TO TAKE
p335_147 IT WAS WORTH A PHOTOGRAPH
p335_149 WE'RE NOT SEEING AN IMAGE OF THE PERSON HE SAID
p335_151 I'D SAY WE SHOULD GIVE IT A WEEK
p335_163 BUT THE PRICE HAS BEEN VERY HIGH
p335_165 THAT NATION IS SOUTH AFRICA
p335_168 HOWEVER DUNDEE DESERVED TO WIN THIS GAME
p335_169 WHERE IS THE STRUCTURE
p335_192 THAT WASN'T FOR ME
p335_193 I AM DELIGHTED WITH TODAY'S WIN
p335_194 WE ARE AWARE OF THE TRIBUNAL CASE
p335_199 THERE WE WERE ON THE FIRST TEE
p335_200 NEXT TIME AROUND IT WILL BE DIFFERENT
p335_201 BROKE THE BIRDIE RECORD
p335_207 THEY SHOULD COME FORWARD
p335_224 WE HAVE GREAT SYMPATHY WITH DANNY
p335_236 I DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWER FOR THEM
p335_241 THE OBSERVER SAW NO EVIDENCE OF FIGHTING
p335_242 YOU CANNOT ALLOW IT TO GO ON
p335_243 IT'S A RECORD LABEL NOT A FORM OF MUSIC
p335_246 TOURISM IS A VITAL INDUSTRY FOR SCOTLAND
p335_251 WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT
p335_252 I THINK HE WAS SURPRISED
p335_253 I PLAYED WELL ON SATURDAY AND AGAIN TODAY
p335_277 THERE IS GREAT DEMAND FOR HUMAN CLONING
p335_278 I'M VERY TIRED BUT IT WAS WORTH IT
p335_281 GOVERNMENT SOURCES SAID IT IS BUILDING UP
p335_287 OTHERS WERE EVEN LESS CONFIDENT
p335_288 I JUST WANT TO CHANGE MY LIFE
p335_296 I'D NEVER BE FREE
p335_299 HE SAID HE WAS SORRY
p335_302 THIS WILL HELP OUR CONFIDENCE
p335_303 THIS LOOKS LIKE IT IS ANYTHING BUT OPEN
p335_321 MOTHERWELL HAVE NO SUCH GOOD FORTUNE
p335_325 STOCK MARKETS WILL BE WATCHING CLOSELY
p335_326 THIS IS A NATIONAL CRISIS
p335_328 AGAIN THE PARALLEL WITH FOOTBALL CAN BE DRAWN
p335_336 WE WILL BE STRONGER IN BERLIN
p335_338 I PUT PRESSURE ON HIM
p335_346 WE HAVE REBUILT AND REFORMED
p335_350 HE REFUSED TO DISCUSS HIS IMMINENT RETIRAL
p335_354 IT TOOK MORE THAN TWO YEARS
p335_355 THERE IS ACCESS FOR DISABLED PEOPLE
p335_358 IS MY WIFE A RACIST
p335_362 IT FEELS LIKE TOO MUCH
p335_369 THIS IS THE LAST THING WE EVER EXPECTED
p335_370 IT LOOKS LIKE PARADISE
p335_371 THIS MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO THE FAMILIES
p335_372 AT THE MOMENT IT IS BEING TREATED AS A TRAGIC ACCIDENT
p335_378 THERE WERE THREE BOYS AND TWO GIRLS
p335_388 I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT HAS HAPPENED
p335_391 YOU DO THAT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO WIN
p335_393 FROM THEN ON SCOTT HAS NEVER LOOKED BACK
p335_404 FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY HAVE GIVEN THEIR SUPPORT
p335_407 THERE WAS NO COHESION
p335_410 COURTENAY TOOK OVER ON TOUR
p335_412 THE GAME IS NOW OPEN
p335_418 LORD SAINSBURY IS NOT A NEWCOMER
p335_424 HAPPILY WE FOUND IT IN THE LIBRARY
p336_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p336_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p336_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p336_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p336_025 I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULT
p336_026 SHE TOOK THEM FOR A TERM
p336_035 IT WAS ANOTHER GOOD IDEA
p336_036 I WANT TO MAKE A VIGOROUS DEFENCE
p336_038 IT IS A TERRIBLE EQUATION
p336_044 THIS ISN'T A NEW PROBLEM
p336_051 IT WAS THE CLIMAX OF THE THING
p336_062 IT WAS A CRUCIAL MOMENT
p336_063 SOMEONE ELSE HAS NOW GOT THEM
p336_068 EVERYONE AT THE SCHOOL IS DELIGHTED FOR STEVEN
p336_076 HE HAS NOT CREATED A FESTIVAL RESOURCE
p336_077 WE COULDN'T AFFORD IT
p336_080 FRANKLY WE SHOULD ALL HAVE SUCH PROBLEMS
p336_083 WOULD YOU HAVE EVER BELIEVED THAT WAS POSSIBLE
p336_090 WE HAVE TO GET THIS SORTED OUT
p336_093 WHEN IS IT EVER ANYTHING ELSE
p336_094 IT'S HARD TO SEE IT
p336_099 THAT STATEMENT HAS NEVER BEEN WITHDRAWN
p336_101 THAT IS UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN
p336_106 DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT
p336_107 THERE IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR
p336_113 IT'S THERE FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AT
p336_114 WE ARE GETTING THERE
p336_117 HE TOO IS KEEN TO REDRESS THE BALANCE
p336_124 THE WHOLE THING WAS JUST UNREAL
p336_128 THE CRITERIA HAVE CHANGED
p336_131 I HAVE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THE COMMONWEALTHS
p336_135 CLEARLY AUDIENCES ARE UNSETTLED
p336_136 IT'S VERY HARD TO PLAN FOR IT
p336_138 THEY ARE DECLINING ELSEWHERE IN THE UK
p336_142 THIS IS THE MAN WHO PROVIDES THE HOPE
p336_151 THE ONLY ANSWER IS A PUBLIC INQUIRY
p336_158 THIS IS THE CULTURE CHANGE IN MEDICINE
p336_162 I HOPE HE GETS IT
p336_183 I WANT THE COMMONWEALTH AND EUROPEAN TITLES
p336_184 IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR HER TO DO HE SAYS
p336_187 CLONING IS NOT READY
p336_193 THIS IS THE START OF A SLIPPERY SLOPE
p336_216 THERE'S NOTHING TO BE GAINED BY IT
p336_222 THE WARNINGS WERE A GOOD REMINDER
p336_224 IT'S THE LAST THING ON MY MIND
p336_231 CARS ARE GREAT FOR GOING LONG DISTANCES
p336_232 IT'S NOT A PARTY NO NO
p336_237 THESE WERE THE DREAMS
p336_238 BUT WE MUST WORK IN HARMONY
p336_245 ONLY FOUR OF HIS PASSENGERS WERE UNINJURED
p336_253 OUR POLICY IS VERY CLEAR ON THIS ISSUE
p336_254 HE HAS REFUSED TO DO THAT
p336_259 I'M HAPPY THAT WE HAVE AGREED
p336_260 ALL OF THEM WERE KILLED
p336_269 I'VE GOT THREE OTHER IDEAS FOR THE DAY
p336_270 SOME INJUSTICE WAS COMMITTED
p336_280 I WAS SHAKING ON THE BLOCKS
p336_283 AWARENESS IN EUROPE OF SCOTLAND IS HIGH
p336_289 IT HAS BECOME VERY CONFUSED
p336_291 IT'S A NATIONAL SPORT
p336_302 I SEEM TO KEEP THIS FOR THE MAJORS
p336_306 THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL MOMENT FOR ME
p336_314 THIS IDEA HAS BEEN AROUND FOR FOUR YEARS
p336_320 YES IT WAS UPLIFTING
p336_323 ONE PAPER WAS NOT RETURNED
p336_325 WE DON'T HAVE MONEY TO GET TO TOWN
p336_343 THE WORK WAS SUSPENDED FOLLOWING THE KIDNAP
p336_348 HE IS VERY MUCH RESPECTED WITHIN THE GROUP
p336_349 PEOPLE WANT TO LEARN
p336_354 NO DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THIS RESPECT
p336_361 BUT THIS RELATIVE SUCCESS HAS NOT BEEN EASY
p336_369 ERIKSSON WOULD HAVE APPROVED
p336_371 IT LOOKED LIKE A WAR ZONE
p336_376 AT THIS POINT WE CAN ONLY SPECULATE
p336_379 IT MAY BE THE FIRST OF MANY
p336_380 IT RUNS IN CYCLES
p336_382 I SPOKE TO HIM YESTERDAY
p336_388 I WAS QUIETLY CONFIDENT ABOUT GETTING THE WIN
p336_393 THE TRUTH IS HE PROBABLY DOESN'T
p336_394 THERE WERE FEW SURPRISES
p336_398 HE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO IT
p336_400 I AM NOT THAT SADISTIC
p336_408 AS IF HE WOULD
p336_416 IT IS EASY TO BE WISE IN HINDSIGHT
p339_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p339_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p339_010 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
p339_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p339_029 WHAT IS A HOUSE WITHOUT IT
p339_035 THIS WOULD GIVE SCOTLAND AROUND EIGHT MEMBERS
p339_038 YOU GO IN THERE AND DO IT
p339_039 WE WERE IN ITALY SUDDENLY WE KNEW
p339_043 I SAID TO HIM
p339_044 LABOUR HAS BEEN FOUND OUT ON PUBLIC SPENDING
p339_060 BUT WHAT DID IT MATTER
p339_067 AND HE'S NOT A BIGOT
p339_072 TODAY IS THE FIRST STEP IN THAT PROCESS
p339_075 BUT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR THAT
p339_077 THAT SHOULD BE FUN
p339_083 OR HAVE THEY
p339_084 THERE IS NO CHANGE IN THE STRATEGY
p339_088 WE SPOKE ABOUT A FEW PEOPLE
p339_100 HE IS A ONE-OFF
p339_101 SIX MEN WILL TAKE THE DECISION
p339_103 WE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED AT THAT
p339_104 IT WAS A DISASTER
p339_111 I ALWAYS LIKED TO GET A LAUGH
p339_115 TODAY IS A VICTORY FOR THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT
p339_119 I THOUGHT IT WAS QUITE GOOD
p339_134 HE WILL BE A MAJOR CHALLENGER NEXT YEAR
p339_144 HE WAS PART OF THE FAMILY
p339_145 I CERTAINLY THINK IT SHOULD BE THERE
p339_147 HOPEFULLY WE CAN PUT IN A PERFORMANCE
p339_151 WE WERE EXTREMELY LUCKY
p339_153 IN FACT THE REASONS ARE SIMPLE
p339_154 THE HEARING IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TODAY
p339_162 MORE CASES ARE EXPECTED
p339_165 HOW CAN THEY SAY THAT
p339_168 I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AN IMPACT OF COURSE
p339_172 IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE WIND
p339_176 THIS WAS CERTAINLY NOT ABOUT MONEY
p339_186 IT SEPARATES THE MEN FROM THE BOYS
p339_189 THE OTHER WAS A FOOTBALL MATCH
p339_190 THEY HAVE THE PLAYERS TO DO IT
p339_191 WHICH IS WORSE
p339_195 FIRST THE PROGRAMME WAS UNBALANCED
p339_197 WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A PARTY
p339_200 I'M VERY HAPPY THAT IT EXPLODED
p339_202 LESTER WAS LIKE THAT
p339_207 IT IS NOT A ROAD OF LIFE
p339_208 IT IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT
p339_212 IF THAT'S THE CASE HE WILL STRUGGLE
p339_216 THEY KNOW THE LANGUAGE
p339_226 THE SIGNS ARE POSITIVE
p339_229 I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN MYSELF
p339_233 NO THEY HAVE PLAYED WELL
p339_237 I THINK WE'RE THE BETTER SIDE
p339_241 ARE YOU GOING TO WIN
p339_242 WE DIDN'T GET THE SUPPLY TO THE FORWARDS
p339_249 THERE IS A GREAT CARRY OVER VALUE
p339_257 IT WAS INDEED A NIGHT TO REMEMBER
p339_260 IT WAS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE
p339_263 THE POLICE ARE HOPELESS
p339_266 A SPOKESMAN REFUSED TO CONFIRM THE FIGURE
p339_285 BUT DO NOT RELY ON IT
p339_290 AND YET THERE HAS BEEN NO GREAT IMPACT
p339_291 WAS THAT NOT AWFUL
p339_296 I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY ON THAT
p339_301 IT TURNED OUT TO HAVE BEEN THREE HOURS
p339_302 THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT
p339_305 WE KNOW THE GOALS WILL COME
p339_307 THEY NEED TO LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES
p339_322 YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE
p339_332 WELL THAT WAS THE PLAN
p339_333 THE PROBLEM IS FAIRLY SERIOUS
p339_335 WE WON'T DO THAT
p339_337 SPRINTERS ARE NOT FIT
p339_343 ONLY INJURY HAS PREVENTED THAT HAPPENING BEFORE
p339_348 HOW DO WE GET A BIGGER STAGE
p339_350 I THOUGHT THEIR COMMITMENT WAS SUPERB
p339_359 IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THERE IS NO CHANCE
p339_365 THIS IS A NEW BEGINNING
p339_384 WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
p339_390 HE HAS RUN A HELL OF A RACE
p339_404 I'M DELIGHTED WITH OUR PERFORMANCE
p339_407 IT IS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR PRODUCT
p339_413 I SAW IT LATER IN THE NEWS
p339_420 I AM ALSO DELIGHTED FOR ALL THE PLAYERS
p339_422 THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF QUESTIONS
p340_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p340_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p340_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p340_026 WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO DO THAT
p340_027 WE'VE JUST DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
p340_037 THERE WAS ONLY ONE PROBLEM THE TEACHER WAS STILL THERE
p340_048 NONE OF THE PIECES WAS COMMISSIONED
p340_049 IT IS SOMEWHERE TO BE
p340_062 IT'S THERE FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AT
p340_071 THEY DO NOT DELIVER
p340_075 WOULD SHE REMEMBER THE MUSIC
p340_086 I'VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THE COMMONWEALTHS
p340_109 ANOTHER MAN SAID IT WAS HORRIBLE
p340_111 BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW
p340_122 MY BODY IS CLEARLY CAPABLE
p340_124 SHE WAS NOT HARD DONE BY
p340_126 WE ARE IN THE END GAME
p340_129 IT IS THE SAME OLD STORY
p340_130 YOU NEED THAT FREEDOM IN SOCIETY
p340_133 I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT ACCEPT THIS DECISION
p340_136 I RECOMMEND A TOUR
p340_138 I WAS INVITED TO WORK IN GERMANY
p340_141 HE WAS SHAKING LIKE A LEAF
p340_143 IT LOOKS LIKE A HIT
p340_154 I'VE NEVER REGRETTED MY DECISION
p340_161 HE HAS TO LEARN
p340_162 HE TOO WILL RETURN
p340_163 WHAT THEN IS WRONG
p340_168 THEY DID A VERY GOOD JOB
p340_169 IT HAS BEEN A WASTE OF TIME
p340_180 ARE YOU THE MAN FROM THE HERALD
p340_190 I THINK IT WAS JUST A TRAGIC ACCIDENT
p340_196 THERE IS NO OTHER WAY
p340_198 THIS IS A DISASTER FOR US
p340_203 HE HAD BEEN ON HOLIDAY VISITING HIS GRANDMOTHER
p340_205 THAT'S MY DAUGHTER ACTING
p340_214 HE WAS OUTSTANDING TODAY - THE BEST PLAYER ON THE PARK
p340_224 OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH HER FAMILY
p340_227 SO THERE WE WON
p340_228 I DON'T LIKE TO FAIL
p340_242 I'M STILL AN AMATEUR IN THAT SENSE
p340_243 WE JUST DID NOT WANT TO BELIEVE IT
p340_245 I SHOULD THINK SO TOO
p340_247 THEY DESERVED TO BEAT US IN THE REPLAY
p340_249 WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS RIGHT
p340_253 I AM NOT A LIAR
p340_254 LET'S MAKE THIS CLEAR
p340_270 I HOPE HE COMES BACK
p340_273 I AM DELIGHTED FOR THEM
p340_276 THEY MIGHT BE SURPRISED BY THE RESPONSE
p340_277 I'VE DONE IT ALL
p340_278 WE HAVE WORKED WELL WITH THEM FOR YEARS
p340_285 THEY WERE VERY UNFAIR TO HIM
p340_288 WE COULD HAVE HAD NO NEW MONEY
p340_290 IT WASN'T REALLY LIKE THAT AT ALL
p340_296 I THOUGHT THE DANCING WAS OVER
p340_299 HE'S ALREADY MADE HISTORY
p340_300 POLICE HAVE APPEALED FOR WITNESSES
p340_305 WE WILL NOT GIVE UP ON THE TRUTH
p340_310 THE DIFFERENCE WAS AMAZING
p340_313 YOU HAVE TO FEEL FOR THE GUY
p340_325 THERE WAS NOTHING SINISTER IN THAT
p340_327 IS THAT WHAT IT'S ABOUT
p340_333 IT SEEMED SO PERSONAL
p340_334 WOULD THAT BE FOR MEN AND WOMEN
p340_342 THEY SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO ME
p340_343 WELL THERE CAN BE NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ONE
p340_347 IT WAS LIKE SOMEONE HAD DIED
p340_348 I AM AN INNOCENT MAN
p340_352 SHE IS ALSO CLAIMING CONSTRUCTIVE AND UNFAIR DISMISSAL
p340_354 HE WAS ELECTED AS A COUNCILLOR LAST YEAR
p340_359 IT ALL HAPPENED SO QUICKLY
p340_363 GOVERNMENTS WILL HAVE TO RESPOND
p340_367 I LOVE IT HERE
p340_369 FRANKLY IT WAS DISGUSTING
p340_371 HE WAS NOT ENTIRELY CORRECT
p340_373 WAR IS NOT THE ACTION
p340_374 THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH OF THEM
p340_384 WE HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE
p340_387 I DIDN'T SEE IT
p340_390 IT IS A CHALLENGE FOR ALL OF US
p340_393 THERE'S ALSO THE POINT
p340_402 IT WANTS THEM TO GO HOME
p340_403 I HAD A BALL TODAY
p340_408 MY DAUGHTER WAS REALLY REALLY INNOCENT
p341_001 PLEASE CALL STELLA
p341_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p341_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p341_035 I AM PROUD OF MOMENTS LIKE THAT
p341_036 THAT WAS NO SURPRISE TO ME
p341_037 THIS HAS BEEN BLOWN OUT OF ALL PROPORTION
p341_038 THERE IS NO ESCAPE
p341_041 HE WAS ARRESTED BUT LATER RELEASED WITHOUT CHARGE
p341_047 IF YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR TREATMENT YOU PAY FOR TREATMENT
p341_048 ALL THE LADS ARE TOTALLY FOCUSED ON THAT
p341_053 IT'S TO DO WITH PLAY
p341_055 I'VE JUST GOT TO DO THIS
p341_057 SO THE PROCESS WAS REFINED
p341_065 HE HAD PLAYED WELL IN THAT CENTRAL ROLE
p341_074 THE FEELING IS AWESOME
p341_076 BUT THERE WAS A SHIFT
p341_086 YOU CAN'T KEEP THEM SEPARATE
p341_095 IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE TO PLAY
p341_100 I DON'T THINK IT COULD BE CLEARER
p341_101 THAT MEANT THE SEARCH WAS UNLAWFUL
p341_110 IT WAS LOVE OF HELEN AND THE CHILDREN
p341_112 I LOVE THIS TOURNAMENT
p341_122 HE HAD OTHER THINGS ON HIS MIND
p341_129 IT ENDED AS IT BEGAN IN CONFUSION
p341_132 COUNCIL OFFICIALS ARE INVOLVED ALONG WITH THE TRANSPORT INDUSTRY
p341_136 HE WAS HAPPY THE BBC WAS HAPPY THE LISTENERS WERE HAPPY
p341_151 SEAN CONNERY DID NOT DISAPPOINT
p341_160 YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A STOPPAGE IN NOVEMBER
p341_161 THESE MATTERS ARE NOW BEHIND US
p341_163 I LOVE THE TRADITION OF VAUDEVILLE
p341_164 IT WAS THEN INTO OVERTIME
p341_173 MY HOUSE WAS SHAKING AT THE TIME
p341_174 THEY WILL KNOW THEY DESERVE TO BE THERE
p341_175 OF COURSE HE IS
p341_178 THEY RECORDED THEIR DEBUT ALBUM IN NEW YORK
p341_181 THAT'S HOW IT WORKED IN BOSNIA
p341_187 HIS SIGNATURE IS HIS HANDWRITING
p341_188 HE ADMITTED THERE WERE TWO ASPECTS OF FEAR
p341_199 WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA
p341_201 IT'S FUN AND CHALLENGING BUT IT IS NOT EASY
p341_202 NOW IT IS OFFICIAL BARRY FERGUSON IS STAYING WITH RANGERS
p341_205 I FEEL PRIVILEGED TO BE HERE
p341_221 HE ASKED ME IN A TOLERANCE ZONE
p341_225 HERE ARE SOME POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
p341_226 THAT'S THE DAY JOB
p341_237 MRS ANDERSON SAID THIS ONE WAS DIFFERENT
p341_248 I WILL NOT BE PRESSURED
p341_254 SUB NOT USED MCKAY
p341_256 MIND YOU WHO WOULDN'T
p341_257 THAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN PAKISTAN BUT IN BRITAIN
p341_259 OUR SYSTEM IS ARCHAIC
p341_262 WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE BEACH BOYS AND BRIAN WILSON
p341_263 THIS TIME THERE WERE NO SUCH REWARDS
p341_264 HE SAID MR HOLLAND WAS A DISGRACE
p341_265 I GAVE HIM A WAY OUT AND HE TOOK IT
p341_268 WE DON'T HAVE THE CREDIBLE EVIDENCE
p341_270 I'M JUST DOING ARTWORK
p341_280 I HOPE MY SUCCESSOR WILL DO THE SAME
p341_299 THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR THE COMMITTEE
p341_302 BUT IT WAS FOR CHARITY JUST A BIT OF FUN
p341_305 HOWEVER THERE ARE ALSO MANY AREAS OF AGREEMENT
p341_307 THE DOW JONES IS WAY UP
p341_313 CALDERWOOD WOULD AGREE WITH THAT
p341_316 I THOUGHT HE WAS PART OF THE CAMERA
p341_339 THEY TOLD US ABOUT IT THE NEXT DAY
p341_340 TWO YEARS AGO THE COMMISSION DID NOT WANT TO GET INVOLVED
p341_357 THIS IS NORMAL FOR HIM NOW
p341_363 THE PLACE BECAME A WAR ZONE
p341_365 IT WAS TO GET EVEN BETTER FOR MOTHERWELL
p341_366 BOTH PARTIES CAN WIN AND SCOTLAND CAN WIN AS A RESULT
p341_369 IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO PLAY ON CENTRE COURT
p341_373 HE IS VERY UNLIKELY TO FEATURE AGAINST IRELAND
p341_374 SEE IT WHILE YOU CAN
p341_379 I DIDN'T DO TOO BADLY MYSELF
p341_380 WE CANNOT LOSE IT
p341_381 THEY HAVE LEARNED FROM THAT
p341_383 CHRIS PATERSON IS A CLASS ACT
p341_386 THAT GAVE US SOME CONFIDENCE
p341_387 NO-ONE HAS YET BEEN CHARGED
p341_391 IT IS THE HOLIDAY PROGRAMME WITH A MORTGAGE
p341_392 THERE WAS SOMEONE ON THE FLOOR
p341_396 BUT IT IS ALL BY DESIGN
p343_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p343_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p343_009 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
p343_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
p343_016 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
p343_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p343_020 MANY CONTEMPLATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p343_032 BUT IT MIGHT HAVE DONE
p343_035 I READ IT EVERY YEAR
p343_038 WE ARE A TEAM OF HARD WORKERS
p343_043 WE'VE ALL BEEN HERE BEFORE
p343_044 I HAD TROUBLES WITH THE PRODUCERS
p343_049 I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT
p343_051 I EXPECT A RAPID RESPONSE
p343_054 I MUST TAKE A SEAT
p343_061 HE SHOULD BE A GREAT ASSET
p343_062 BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY FOR ANOTHER DAY
p343_065 I'M JUST DELIGHTED TO TAKE IT
p343_071 WE PLAYED TOO DEEPLY
p343_075 THE SCRIPT WAS FUNNY
p343_080 PAINFUL BUT ONLY BECAUSE IT'S TRUE
p343_085 WE SHOULD KEEP THIS RECENT ASSAULT IN PERSPECTIVE
p343_087 NO ONE WAS LISTENING
p343_091 IT'S TERRIBLE THAT THIS IS HAPPENING
p343_094 IT IS PAR FOR THE COURSE OF COURSE
p343_102 I AM NOT A DOCTOR
p343_103 IT IS ALL IN THE MIND
p343_110 IT'S UP TO THEM TO DECIDE
p343_114 AFTER THIS THEY WERE ALWAYS IN THE DRIVING SEAT
p343_118 THAT IS THE POSITION THE MOD HAS ADOPTED
p343_119 THE HEARING WAS EXPECTED TO LAST SIX WEEKS
p343_120 I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS DECISION
p343_125 BUT IT'S BEEN KEPT TO A MINIMUM
p343_144 BUT NOT ALL WERE SO DEFIANT
p343_146 I TOLD THAT TO THE POLICE
p343_147 ON THE OTHER HAND THE POSTER DID NOT HELP
p343_155 THEY'VE BEEN WONDERFUL TO ME
p343_161 THAT NEVER CAME TO COURT AS A CHARGE
p343_163 THE LATTER WAY IS MY WAY
p343_169 ON REFLECTION IT WAS REALLY QUITE EXCITING
p343_175 IT IS THOUGH THE LAW IS NOT CLEAR CUT
p343_176 HE WILL WANT TO UTILISE THE MIDFIELD
p343_186 IF HE DOES HE HAS A REAL CHANCE OF GOLD
p343_191 THAT TELLS YOU SOMETHING
p343_217 THIS WAS NOT A SUMMIT ABOUT THE EURO
p343_220 I DIDN'T ACTUALLY WORK UP A SPEECH
p343_225 THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
p343_233 WE COULD LEARN A LOT FROM THEM
p343_235 THE PLAYERS ARE OBVIOUSLY KEEN TO DO WELL
p343_242 OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE ARE WORRIED IN THE WEST MIDLANDS
p343_245 THEY HAVE NOT BEEN NAMED
p343_250 ACTUALLY NOTHING MUCH WILL CHANGE
p343_255 HOWEVER MY POSITION REMAINS THE SAME
p343_257 HORSES ARE NOT AFFECTED
p343_262 HE KNOWS THE COURSE
p343_274 THERE WAS NO ARGUMENT
p343_276 SHE IS A VALUABLE MEMBER OF GOVERNMENT
p343_288 THE SECOND ASPECT WAS THE FEAR OF FAILURE
p343_306 STRICTLY SPEAKING IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE THIS
p343_312 IT WAS NOT A COVER-UP
p343_313 THE CHILDREN CONTINUE TO TALK TO US
p343_318 WE TOLD THEM IN AUGUST
p343_324 OTHERWISE WE WOULD ALL PAY THE PRICE
p343_326 IT IS TIME HE SAID
p343_338 HE DIDN'T LET ME DOWN
p343_353 IT IS SAFE IN OUR HANDS
p343_357 TENANTS WILL BE UNABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES
p343_360 THE TRIBUNAL CONTINUES TODAY
p343_362 SO FAR THE SCHEME HAS NOT BEEN USED IN SCOTLAND
p343_363 SURE THAT ALREADY HAPPENS IN NEW ZEALAND
p343_366 SURELY THEY WERE ON A HIDING TO NOTHING
p343_367 IN THE END HOWEVER IT ALL CAME TOGETHER
p343_371 I HAVE TO TAKE SOME OF THE BLAME
p343_378 I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE SKIPPER
p343_382 WE DON'T DO THIS FOR EVERYONE OF COURSE
p343_388 MY WIFE AND FAMILY ARE THE SUPPORT SYSTEM
p343_396 SUB NOT USED MCARTHUR
p343_400 I LOVE THE FEEL OF THE PLACE
p345_001 PLEASE CALL STELLA
p345_006 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
p345_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p345_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p345_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p345_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p345_025 THIS IS A NEW ERA
p345_029 WHAT IS THE NEW RELIGION
p345_036 WE'RE IN A STATE OF SHOCK AND DISBELIEF
p345_039 A KILLER IS ALSO ON THE LOOSE
p345_040 RANGERS ARE STRUGGLING AND THEIR TEAM HAVE INJURIES
p345_047 HIS RECORD WITH ENGLAND WAS NOT GOOD
p345_051 IT WAS TIME TO ACT
p345_054 WE WILL BE PAYING AGENCY RATES
p345_056 WE EXPECT THEM TO DELIVER FOR US
p345_062 IF TRUE IT WILL BE THE FIRST SIGN OF DISSENT
p345_075 THE DEFENDER MADE AN IMPRESSIVE DEBUT
p345_088 HE WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD IN HOSPITAL
p345_091 INSIDE THE ATMOSPHERE WAS QUIET
p345_095 HE WAS AT IT AGAIN YESTERDAY
p345_104 I ASKED FOR A PICTURE AND SHE SAID NO PROBLEM
p345_106 IT'S AS EVENTFUL AS IT IS MOMENTOUS
p345_111 THEY WERE BACK IN FAVOUR WITH THE SAC
p345_117 IT IS REALLY GOOD NEWS
p345_123 AT THE MOMENT THE SUCCESS IN GERMANY IS GOOD
p345_126 THE TORIES ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAS CERTAINLY BEEN COLOURFUL
p345_127 FINDING THE ANSWER IS A HUGELY ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE
p345_133 I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT ONE CAME FROM
p345_139 THEY WERE PART OF OUR OWN FAMILY
p345_149 THAT'S A HUGE AMOUNT
p345_156 BUT THE DAMAGE HAD BEEN DONE
p345_177 THAT WILL BE THE CASE
p345_190 I WAS NEVER ALONE WITH HER RIGHT
p345_199 I KNOW MY SONS
p345_200 CLEARLY WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS VERY CAREFULLY
p345_205 THE DEVIL OF COURSE WILL BE IN THE DETAIL
p345_206 THEN ANOTHER ONE CAME
p345_209 THE LOBBY IS NOT FAILING
p345_212 HE WOULD HAVE COME INTO THE HOUSE
p345_215 AT THE TIME HE WAS A LIVING LEGEND
p345_221 IT'S THE RIGHT THING
p345_224 BUT THIS IS JUST THE START
p345_236 I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THEY WERE
p345_237 RANGERS ARE MY LIFE
p345_238 LOCKERBIE HAS BEEN A TERRIBLE DISASTER FOR EVERYONE
p345_240 THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS
p345_243 THERE IS A HANDFUL OF REWARDING PAINTINGS
p345_245 THIS IS WONDERFUL NEWS
p345_246 I AM APPALLED BY THIS NEWS
p345_249 IT IS UNDERSTOOD HE HAD BEEN STABBED
p345_255 I DON'T THINK HE WAS BEING VERY FAIR
p345_259 THE OBSERVER SAW NO EVIDENCE OF FIGHTING
p345_261 FATHERHOOD IS IMPORTANT TO TONY BLAIR
p345_280 WE CAN BUILD ON THAT
p345_283 THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THEY WERE ON HIMSELF
p345_284 HIS BODY WAS FOUND IN MAY
p345_289 SURE HE IS THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD
p345_294 BUT THEY MISS THE WHOLE POINT
p345_296 I SAID WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT
p345_298 THIS COULD PROVE A PROBLEM
p345_307 THIS IS TOO MUCH LIKE SCOTLAND
p345_308 I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ANY FIGURE
p345_311 I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE ABANDON
p345_324 BUT COULD IT AFFORD TO RUN IT
p345_328 I AM NOT AGAINST A FURTHER INQUIRY
p345_330 WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT
p345_335 STOCK MARKETS WILL BE WATCHING CLOSELY
p345_336 I JUST WANT TO DO THE GOOD WORK
p345_340 NOW IT WAS SERIOUS
p345_342 HE IS ALREADY IN PLACE
p345_343 NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE HIM
p345_348 I JUST KNOW IT'S A LOT
p345_349 I SAW ONE BODY
p345_351 THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION ABOUT IT
p345_353 IT WAS A VERY BIG WIN FOR US
p345_356 WE HAD A GOOD TIME
p345_359 HOWEVER THE SNOW WAS WELCOMED BY SOME
p345_363 IT IS A ROAD OF DEATH
p345_380 I ALSO THOUGHT THIS IS A FEATURE FILM
p345_392 IT WAS A GAME WE HAD TO WIN
p347_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p347_004 WE ALSO NEED A SMALL PLASTIC SNAKE AND A BIG TOY FROG FOR THE KIDS
p347_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p347_013 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
p347_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p347_028 THERE ARE MOMENTS OF SILENCE
p347_032 IT'S A POLICY WHICH HAS WORKED FOR US
p347_037 AND LOOK AT THE LEADING CONDUCTORS HE SAYS
p347_039 WE'VE TRIED EVERY OTHER WAY
p347_045 HOW MANY CASES HAVE THERE BEEN
p347_046 PETER OF COURSE REFUSES TO CONFORM
p347_050 AND DOES IT EVEN MATTER
p347_052 MY PARENTS ARE EXHAUSTED
p347_058 FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW THE PLAYER IS FREE TO LEAVE
p347_071 I WANTED THE ILLUSION OF SPACE AND DEPTH
p347_073 THEY HAD NOT BEEN HANDCUFFED
p347_080 NO-ONE SAID ANYTHING TO ME
p347_082 THAT IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
p347_087 THIS IS A CLUB ON THE RISE
p347_088 JOHN PRESCOTT IS JOHN PRESCOTT AS THE PRIME MINISTER WOULD SAY
p347_095 WE GAVE THEM THE GOAL
p347_100 BUT WHO SHOT THE PRESIDENT
p347_104 SAFETY WAS ALSO AN ISSUE
p347_118 FACES FROM THE EIGHTIES
p347_120 MARTIN JOHNSON THE ENGLAND CAPTAIN WAS BACK AND COMMANDING
p347_124 THEY WILL DO THEIR OWN THING
p347_128 A YOUNG BRITON HAD A LUCKY ESCAPE
p347_136 I DON'T WANT TO COME DOWN
p347_137 HOWEVER IT'S GOOD TO TURN THE PAGE
p347_148 IS THE WAR OVER
p347_152 PUPILS WERE ALLOWED HOME AT LUNCHTIME
p347_160 WE HAVE NOT HAD A FORMAL REQUEST
p347_165 THEY WON THE TROPHY IN THE HOOPS
p347_168 NOT EVERYONE HOWEVER WAS PLEASED WITH THE PROPOSED CHANGES
p347_169 IT WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO FIT THE WALL
p347_176 IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS THE WOMEN HAVE ACHIEVED A LOT
p347_185 I WAS CHOSEN TO DO THIS
p347_191 EDINBURGH IN FACT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SURVEY
p347_200 IT IS LEGALLY BINDING
p347_202 BEFORE THE GAMES IT WAS PRETTY OPEN
p347_204 HE IS ONLY NOW REGAINING HIS CONFIDENCE
p347_220 IT COULD NOT BE TOO HIGH
p347_227 SHE WILL ALSO GET A PAY RISE
p347_230 THAT'S THE NATIONAL GRID
p347_234 THERE WERE TWO THINGS GOING ON AT ONCE
p347_238 THAT IS THE KEY MESSAGE
p347_243 GLASGOW IS MAKING INROADS IN SOME AREAS
p347_245 DO NOT GO INTO GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS
p347_247 WE ARE STILL GETTING SIGNALS
p347_252 THERE ARE A FEW CHANGES
p347_262 I HAVE JUST GOT TO GET BACK
p347_267 I'M QUITE EMBARRASSED AND ASHAMED OF DOING THAT
p347_268 THE SINGER'S CONDITION WAS NOT SPECIFIED
p347_269 HOW MUCH OF A COP OUT IS THAT
p347_273 LIFE AS MANY PEOPLE KNOW IT IN OTHER WORDS
p347_276 ARGUABLY THEY HAVE ALREADY DONE IT
p347_301 I WILL CARRY ON
p347_302 I THINK IT IS A GREAT SHAME
p347_305 THE CHIEF CONSTABLE IS RIGHT
p347_308 A HOSPITAL SPOKESWOMAN DESCRIBED HIS CONDITION AS STABLE
p347_310 IT'S MY FAVOURITE PLACE TO HANG OUT
p347_312 I LIKE AN IDIOT AGREED
p347_313 COUNCILLOR GORDON HAS REFUSED TO STAND DOWN
p347_318 THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO GRASP THE NETTLE
p347_332 I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT
p347_333 FERGUSON DID NOT HESITATE
p347_343 GOVERNMENT MUST RECOGNISE THE PROBLEMS OF ABERDEEN
p347_346 HIS NAME IS MICHAEL OWEN
p347_347 IT HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE
p347_348 HE'S GOT A GREAT CHANCE OF MAKING IT
p347_349 TARTAN DAY IS NOT A SCOTTISH EVENT
p347_355 I FOOLISHLY HAD DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT
p347_356 AGAIN THIS WAS GENUINE LOYALTY BEING RECOGNISED
p347_362 AND WE'RE TALKING BIG MONEY
p347_368 I'M REALLY PROUD OF MY YOUNG PLAYERS
p347_369 AS IT HAPPENED IT WAS MUCH MORE THAN THAT
p347_382 ELECTION RESULTS ARE EXPECTED SOON
p347_385 THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING
p347_388 IT WAS A LOT OF HARD WORK BUT IT WASN'T DIFFICULT
p347_398 SOME OF THE PLAYERS HAVE NOT PROGRESSED
p347_405 IN THE END IT WILL MEAN AN AWFUL LOT
p347_407 WHICH MEANS IT MATTERS
p347_408 THERE IS GREAT POTENTIAL ON THIS RIVER
p347_415 WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR JOB
p347_416 HOWEVER THERE ARE SIGNS OF DISSENT AMONG HIS COLLEAGUES
p351_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p351_027 I HAVE NOT SEEN THE TERM IMMEDIATE
p351_028 MY DAD IS A HERO
p351_034 TEACHERS HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OFFER
p351_036 THEY ALSO HAVE GOOD NEIGHBOURS
p351_038 THEY ARE NOT ADVERTISED
p351_039 I HAVE GOT A WIFE TO FEED
p351_053 THERE IS NO SIGNATURE ON THIS DOCUMENT
p351_055 THERE WAS MYSTERY BACK THEN
p351_057 NOW IT HAS BECOME A BIG PICTURE
p351_059 HOPEFULLY THEY WILL NOT GO THROUGH WITH IT
p351_060 THEY HAVE BEEN VERY LUCKY WITH THE ICE
p351_063 WE ARE THE GATEWAY TO JUSTICE
p351_065 HIS HANDLING RAISES A WIDER ISSUE
p351_066 WE HAVE GOT THE SCHOOL HOLIDAYS ON
p351_068 THAT JUST WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH
p351_073 SHE WAS MARRIED WITH ONE SON
p351_082 HE WAS REJECTED BECAUSE HE HAD RETIRED
p351_087 THINGS ARE MEANT TO BE
p351_092 FOUR HAD BEEN BROUGHT DOWN
p351_103 YES IT WAS TOO SHORT A NIGHT
p351_113 WHAT'S THE PROBLEM
p351_117 I WILL BE RIDICULED
p351_119 THIS TIME IT WAS OUT OF THE BLUE
p351_125 PITY HE COULDN'T PRODUCE A WINNING BRITISH TEAM
p351_131 HE SAID IT WAS THE WORST POSSIBLE RESULT
p351_134 WE CAN PLAY BETTER THAN THAT
p351_146 MR SMITH WAS DISMISSIVE
p351_147 IT WAS A DISCUSSION PAPER
p351_153 IT CERTAINLY WAS A BIRTHDAY TO REMEMBER
p351_161 PATERSON CAN AFFORD TO BE GENEROUS
p351_166 IT FEELS THAT THE GAME IS OFF
p351_179 MANY OTHER AREAS ARE COMING UP
p351_186 WE ARE STILL PAYING THE PRICE FOR THAT
p351_189 I AM JUST GRATEFUL HE IS ALIVE
p351_200 WE NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HER
p351_204 THE MAN WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD ON ARRIVAL
p351_208 THEY ARE NOT A SET OF OPTIONS
p351_209 IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT AND BEAUTIFUL DAY
p351_211 BUT IT WAS MONEY WELL SPENT
p351_213 AT THE END OF THE DAY ONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL
p351_216 WHICH IS FAIR ENOUGH
p351_219 THIS IS A HISTORIC AGREEMENT
p351_222 HIS WAS THE BEST PERFORMANCE OF THE DAY AFTER ALL
p351_224 IT MAY NOT EVEN BE POSSIBLE
p351_226 PERHAPS IT WAS JUST AS WELL
p351_230 I WOULD HAVE THE HAMMER IN THE CROWD
p351_233 WE'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY
p351_244 THE HOME TEAM ALSO HAD THEIR MOMENTS
p351_245 HAVEN'T BEEN SO LUCKY SINCE
p351_246 HE IS UNDER NO ILLUSIONS
p351_253 NOW THE SHOW IS FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION
p351_256 THE OLD MANAGER HE DIDN'T LIKE ME
p351_262 I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT
p351_271 DON'T YOU THINK IT WAS A FINE PERFORMANCE
p351_281 THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM DOESN'T DELIVER
p351_287 I'VE NOT SAID ANYTHING TO THEM THEY KNOW
p351_289 I FEEL IT IS VERY IRRATIONAL
p351_300 MY MIND WAS MADE UP
p351_301 IT WAS AN ONGOING EXERCISE
p351_303 HE THEN DID JUST THAT
p351_308 I'VE PLAYED THEM ALL IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE
p351_316 BUT THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING NOW
p351_319 THEY WERE NOT UP TO THE REQUIRED STANDARD
p351_323 OTHERS ARE EXPECTED TO DO SO SOON
p351_327 OUR APPROACH WILL BE DIFFERENT
p351_328 IT'S MY INITIAL BACKGROUND
p351_332 HE ALSO CALLED IN AT ANOTHER FARM
p351_333 BUT HE SEEMED TO ENJOY THE CHALLENGE
p351_336 I LOST A PART OF ME
p351_361 FURTHER DETAILS ARE EXPECTED LATER
p351_362 WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
p351_363 YOU WILL NEVER FORGET THE CLUTCHING HORROR
p351_367 NOW WE SEE THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL POLITICS
p351_386 NEITHER WAS IN THE SQUAD ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY
p351_400 YOU FIND IT BIZARRE
p351_401 I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS SEASON
p351_403 BRITAIN HASN'T SEEN IT IN THIS WAY
p351_404 IT SHOULD BE A GREAT GAME THOUGH
p351_405 BUT IS HE
p351_406 SO IT'S A DAILY STRUGGLE
p351_407 BUT THE FOREIGN SECRETARY CAN COPE
p351_414 THIS IS A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME
p351_417 THE PLANE WAS SHAKING
p351_420 WE WILL BE PLEASED TO TALK TO THEM
p360_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p360_004 WE ALSO NEED A SMALL PLASTIC SNAKE AND A BIG TOY FROG FOR THE KIDS
p360_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION
p360_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p360_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p360_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p360_033 IT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME
p360_043 THAT HAS NOW GONE
p360_044 DONALD IS GENUINE IN TRYING TO BE INCLUSIVE
p360_054 THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT
p360_060 BUT THERE IS NO EASY OPTION
p360_068 NOR WAS IT A GAME WITHOUT ITS LESSONS
p360_078 THE QUESTION WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH
p360_085 HE BECAME ENCHANTED WITH THE PROCESS
p360_088 THEY COULDN'T KEEP IT TOGETHER
p360_090 WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THEM
p360_093 THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT INTERESTING
p360_099 IT WAS THE DREADED SENTENCE
p360_100 I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED IT
p360_114 MR DOCHERTY SAID THE WHOLE FAMILY WAS SHOCKED
p360_115 IT HAS NO PLACE IN FOOTBALL
p360_117 THIS IS A CLASSIC
p360_124 SO MANY PEOPLE WILL BE AFFECTED BY THIS
p360_125 IT WAS ALL VERY GOOD STUFF
p360_127 WE ARE UNDER NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT THIS
p360_128 BUT THEY ARE A GOOD TEAM
p360_132 I KNEW THAT WE NEEDED TO GET OUT
p360_133 I HAD A TRAIN TO CATCH
p360_134 AND THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT BELIEF
p360_137 THE ONLY SAFE INVESTMENT IS CASH
p360_139 ELECTIONS WOULD FOLLOW IN ABOUT TWO YEARS
p360_141 THAT WAS THE THEORY
p360_146 WHO WAS BEING AFFECTED
p360_154 BUT OTHER MINISTERS ARE NOT CONVINCED
p360_162 I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO IT
p360_166 A GOOD ACTOR DOESN'T THINK
p360_167 BUT THE ACTION IS ABOUT TO BE RESTARTED
p360_178 THE POLICE HAVE AN AWFUL LOT TO EXPLAIN
p360_181 WE ARE REALLY IMPRESSED
p360_190 WHAT COULD WE DO
p360_192 BUT THERE WAS NO GOING BACK
p360_193 THERE ARE SOME GOOD PEOPLE IN THERE
p360_199 THEY ARE PROTESTING BUT THEY KNOW IT CANNOT GO ON
p360_202 I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT
p360_205 WE DIDN'T AND IT WORKED FOR US
p360_208 THAT REMAINS THE UNANSWERED QUESTION
p360_209 EVERYONE IS TOO UPSET TO COMMENT
p360_212 PENSIONS ARE A LONG-TERM INVESTMENT
p360_213 AN ANNOUNCEMENT IS EXPECTED SOON
p360_214 IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS
p360_221 THAT HAS NOT CHANGED
p360_229 LABOUR WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY REMAIN IN CONTROL
p360_246 JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WE SUPPOSE
p360_248 NO ONE WAS INJURED
p360_249 WE HAVE HAD OUR DEBATE
p360_250 IT IS PART OF HIS GAME
p360_251 DID HE JUST WANT TO BE ON TELLY
p360_256 THEY WERE ALL ON A MISSION
p360_257 HUMAN BEINGS ARE ALWAYS THE SAME
p360_258 YOU WILL GAIN FROM THAT
p360_259 IT MAKES ME FEEL DIFFICULT
p360_262 HE COULD STILL BE PRESIDENT
p360_263 IT CAN TAKE A LONG TIME
p360_267 THE FIRST TIME YOU READ A PLAY
p360_282 IT WAS IMPORTANT TO BRING THEM ALL TOGETHER
p360_294 WE ARE IN IT FOR THE LONG-TERM
p360_297 AND MICHAEL WAS JUST GREAT
p360_299 WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED TO GET MARRIED
p360_304 WE WILL NOT TOLERATE IT
p360_309 HAVE WE NOT BEEN HERE BEFORE
p360_325 FOR ME ANY MANAGER IS GOOD
p360_330 I HAVE NO IDEA
p360_334 IT WILL BE UP TO THE GOVERNMENT
p360_335 THAT IS A TRAGEDY
p360_337 A CHILD IS NOT A PRODUCT
p360_339 YOU CAN'T GET THE EXPERIENCE IN AUSTRIA
p360_341 THERE WILL BE NO BACKING DOWN
p360_342 THE ATMOSPHERE WAS EXCELLENT
p360_345 HOW DID IT ALL COME ABOUT
p360_359 HE HAS NEVER LET THEM DOWN
p360_374 WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
p360_392 IT IS A NATURAL REACTION
p360_397 IT IS A RELIEF
p360_418 THERE'S NO PLACE TO HIDE
p360_422 THEY NEED TIME TO THINK
p361_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p361_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p361_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p361_015 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
p361_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p361_025 SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE
p361_027 HE MAY NOT NEED TO FORCE THAT MESSAGE
p361_033 IT IS A CASE OF TAKING A RISK
p361_037 THIS DECISION IS FOLLY
p361_044 I'M SURE HE DOES
p361_046 THE ANSWER WAS WRONG
p361_047 THEY NEED TO BE HELPED
p361_050 IT IS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG
p361_061 AS GOOD AS THEY COME
p361_062 IT IS NOT FOR ME TO SAY
p361_065 I THOUGHT IT WAS QUITE A POSITIVE RESULT
p361_072 THE PROBLEM IS NOT CONFINED TO THE UK
p361_081 KENNY MILLER MIGHT COME THROUGH
p361_082 WORKERS WILL NOW BE BALLOTED ON THE OFFER
p361_088 IT'S JUST A FAILING SERVICE
p361_090 I WAS SAYING NO
p361_092 I AM DELIGHTED TO HEAR THIS NEWS
p361_100 WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN
p361_103 IT COULD TAKE SOME TIME
p361_110 WHICH IS WHERE WE COME IN
p361_116 YOU SHOULD ENJOY THE DAY
p361_125 AND IF THEY FAIL
p361_127 SOCIAL WORKERS ARE ON STAND-BY TO HELP
p361_133 IT IS CALLED A KILLING IN THE TRADE
p361_134 IT'S A MATTER FOR THE COMMITTEE
p361_139 IT HAS TO FIND OUT WHAT WENT WRONG
p361_151 I AM EXTREMELY SAD
p361_157 SOMETHING HAS TO BE PUT IN PLACE
p361_162 THIS MEANS A LOT OF HARD DECISIONS
p361_163 THAT COMES AT A COST
p361_167 THE OMENS ARE NOT GOOD
p361_169 THEN THERE'S THE CASTING
p361_173 CAN HE DO IT
p361_176 IF THEY WISH TO GO THEY CAN GO
p361_182 I CAN SEE IT NOW
p361_189 NOW HE IS BACK ON TOP AGAIN
p361_192 FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION
p361_196 THEY WILL BE VERY PHYSICAL
p361_200 ON THE FACE OF IT THIS IS EXCELLENT NEWS
p361_206 WE WILL BE WORKING ON THAT THIS WEEK ALL RIGHT
p361_225 I DON'T KNOW THE FULL STORY
p361_227 MIND YOU IT WOULDN'T BE A BAD IDEA
p361_238 NEIL IS NEVER GOING TO COME BACK
p361_242 IT'S TO DO WITH THIS PLACE
p361_243 IT'S A TECHNICAL DEMAND
p361_258 HE WILL APPEAR IN COURT TODAY
p361_264 THERE IS NO OTHER OFFER ON THE TABLE
p361_267 IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY
p361_279 NO REASON WAS GIVEN
p361_293 WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT THEN
p361_295 WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE
p361_301 THEN IT WILL COME
p361_304 I WILL BUILD A HOUSE ON THE SITE
p361_307 THEY HAVE TO GET THAT SORTED
p361_311 A WINTER OF DISCONTENT AWAITS
p361_313 I AM NOT READY TO WALK AWAY
p361_320 I HAVE SOME COMMENTS
p361_328 IT'S ALL ABOUT UNFINISHED BUSINESS
p361_329 OUR OWN PEOPLE ARE COMING OVER ON FRIDAY
p361_330 IN SCOTLAND THERE SHOULD BE VIGILANCE
p361_334 HE SHOULD EMERGE AS THE WINNER
p361_338 IT IS THEIR DAY
p361_343 I HAVE A COLD
p361_347 THIS IS STILL HAPPENING IN THE US
p361_354 IT MUST NOT HAPPEN
p361_362 HE COULD HAVE GIVEN THEM A LOT
p361_364 IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
p361_371 WELL YOU DON'T HAVE TIME
p361_372 IT IS VERY FUNNY
p361_373 I JUST HOPE IT'S NOT TONIGHT AGAINST US
p361_374 THIS IS GOOD NEWS FOR THE INDUSTRY
p361_378 I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
p361_382 HE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE APPROVED
p361_383 CONDITIONS WERE LESS THAN IDEAL
p361_386 IT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED
p361_388 FIRSTLY WE DON'T KNOW WE CAN DO THIS
p361_394 IT DIDN'T MATTER WHO WAS IN THEIR WAY
p361_406 IT IS TRULY MASTERLY PERFORMANCE
p361_409 WEDNESDAY NIGHT WAS A DIFFICULT TIME FOR BRITTON
p361_413 THAT CAN BENEFIT THE LARGER COMPANIES
p362_004 WE ALSO NEED A SMALL PLASTIC SNAKE AND A BIG TOY FROG FOR THE KIDS
p362_005 SHE CAN SCOOP THESE THINGS INTO THREE RED BAGS AND WE WILL GO MEET HER WEDNESDAY AT THE TRAIN STATION
p362_007 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
p362_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p362_032 I HAVE A VERY STRONG OPINION ABOUT THIS
p362_040 THEY HAD A CONFESSION
p362_047 I AM SO UPSET
p362_049 THEY FINISHED SECOND AND THIRD
p362_053 WE'VE ALWAYS HAD THREE OPTIONS AND NONE OF THEM ARE PERFECT
p362_056 THIS WAS NO ACCIDENT
p362_057 HE IS A LAW UNTO HIMSELF
p362_063 POLICING THE PROFESSION IS IMPORTANT
p362_067 I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT
p362_075 BUT THERE IS GOOD AND BAD
p362_079 I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS
p362_082 IT MEANS THE MARGIN FOR ERROR IS TIGHT
p362_087 ONE IS INVESTMENT ONE IS REFORM
p362_092 MY HUSBAND WAS ANGRY
p362_094 INSTEAD THEY WERE OPENLY ATTEMPTING TO BE HELPFUL
p362_101 THIS IS COMPLETE NONSENSE
p362_104 THEY KNOW THEIR SON WAS MURDERED
p362_107 THE TASK IS ENORMOUS
p362_122 I GOT THE SURPRISE OF MY LIFE
p362_124 HE SEEMS TO BE USED TO THE ATTENTION
p362_128 I HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE
p362_145 THE CHOICE IS SIMPLE
p362_147 I DON'T THINK WE DESERVED TO LOSE
p362_153 A CENTURY ON LITTLE HAS CHANGED
p362_156 HE IS HAVING A NIGHTMARE
p362_185 SHE HAS THE BIGGEST PART
p362_191 I THINK HE'S DONE IT A FEW TIMES
p362_199 WE KNOW THE QUALITY OF LIFE GOES UP
p362_200 WHO ARE THE PUBLIC
p362_205 THEY SHOULD NOT BE BLAMED FOR IT
p362_207 GLASGOW IS A VERY WELCOMING PLACE
p362_210 WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY
p362_228 SADLY THEY DID NOT
p362_229 WE HAVE NOWHERE TO GO
p362_232 THAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED
p362_236 YOU MEAN HE DIDN'T GET THE GIRL
p362_237 HE NOW LIVES IN EDINBURGH WITH HIS WIFE CAROLINE
p362_242 MENTAL HEALTH IS A MASSIVE ISSUE
p362_244 WE DON'T WANT TO BE TOO INTRUSIVE
p362_247 THIS WOULD GIVE SCOTLAND AROUND EIGHT MEMBERS
p362_248 IN SAYING THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO GET ON WITH IT
p362_249 THE DOOR IS OPEN
p362_263 WE COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT THIS
p362_265 SUBSTANTIAL POCKETS OF RESISTANCE REMAIN
p362_267 HERE HE IS IN EFFECT APPOINTING HIMSELF A JUDGE
p362_270 WE ARE MOVING ON
p362_271 THIS IS NOT A CRISIS
p362_282 I WANT MY COUNTRY TO BE A REPUBLIC NOT AN EMPIRE
p362_288 I DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEM
p362_289 IT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA THAT MAKES SENSE
p362_290 YET IT SEEMED TO WORK
p362_292 I HAVE NEVER FELT SO WELL
p362_314 IS THAT RIGHT
p362_317 HE IS FIRM BUT INCLUSIVE AND VERY FAIR
p362_318 IT IS GOOD NEWS FOR US
p362_320 HE'S A GOOD PLAYER BUT HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE
p362_322 I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY REAL
p362_323 THREE OTHER PEOPLE WERE TREATED FOR MINOR INJURIES
p362_328 IT WILL BE A NEW EXPERIENCE
p362_331 THE TIME COMMITMENT IS THE BIGGEST THING
p362_343 EUROPE WILL BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE CUTS
p362_348 THEY ARE A VERY GOOD TEAM
p362_357 THE PROGRAMME WAS AWFUL
p362_359 THAT IS VERY HARD ALONE
p362_362 THE SAME GOES FOR RUSSIA
p362_363 THEY WENT DOWN TOGETHER
p362_371 WE NEED TO INCREASE THE MEMBERSHIP
p362_378 SO THAT IS IT FOR ANOTHER YEAR
p362_383 I TOLD HER AND SHE WAS EXTREMELY GRATEFUL
p362_385 HE HAD TAKEN EVERYTHING FROM ME
p362_386 IT'S A GOOD OFFER BY ANY STANDARDS
p362_391 HE CAN WIN EVERY WEEK
p362_400 YOU HOPE HE PREVAILS
p362_401 MY MOTHER WAS GETTING ON AT ME
p362_406 HE ADDED THAT HE FELT UNDERMINED
p362_408 HE DECLINED TO BE MORE SPECIFIC
p362_413 WE ARE TRYING TO DO IT PROPERLY
p362_414 WE ACTUALLY HAD A LAUGH ABOUT THAT
p362_422 HE GOT THE PART
p362_423 OR RATHER IT ISN'T
p362_424 HE REFUSED TO NAME THE SURVIVORS
p363_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p363_004 WE ALSO NEED A SMALL PLASTIC SNAKE AND A BIG TOY FROG FOR THE KIDS
p363_012 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
p363_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p363_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p363_024 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
p363_032 IF THAT IS THE CASE IT IS A BREAKTHROUGH
p363_035 I THINK IT IS WIDE OPEN
p363_037 IT'S ON WITH A ROLLER
p363_041 THE IMPACT WAS IMMEDIATE
p363_045 IN MY EXPERIENCE HE DOES NOT DO THAT
p363_049 I WAS NOT OVERLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS
p363_053 SO NOW WE KNOW
p363_056 THE DEFENDER SHOULD HAVE WON THE BLOODY BA
p363_067 IT WAS FAR FROM BUSINESS AS USUAL
p363_074 WE ARE NOT COMMENTING AT THE MOMENT
p363_079 THE COURSE HAS HELPED A LOT
p363_080 ALL THE TIME THAT NUMBER WAS COMING DOWN AND DOWN
p363_084 THEY ARE DIFFICULT AWARDS TO DECIDE
p363_087 HE LATER TOLD THE HERALD IT IS TRUE
p363_094 WHAT HAS HAPPENED
p363_100 WE TALK ABOUT EFFECTIVE MILITARY ACTION
p363_101 I CAN'T GET IT
p363_109 IT CAN BE VERY WORRYING
p363_111 WE ARE MAKING NO COMMENT
p363_125 THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM
p363_126 HE ANNOUNCED HIS PLANS
p363_128 WE ARE GETTING NOT A PENNY
p363_129 LOOK AT THE TURN-OUT
p363_137 SHE DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING THE NIGHT BEFORE
p363_146 THERE'S A LOT OF IT GOING ON
p363_154 HIS BODY WAS NEVER FOUND
p363_156 WE HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY BUSY
p363_165 I ALWAYS SAVOUR THE COMPANY OF THE VOICE
p363_166 MY FATHER AND MOTHER ARE
p363_175 SCOTLAND WON BY SIX WICKETS
p363_178 THAT WAS A HUGE EXPERIENCE
p363_179 PERHAPS IT WAS JUST AS WELL
p363_190 IT WAS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT
p363_195 WHY IS HE NOT FIGHTING FOR THE UNION
p363_199 WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE A POINT
p363_200 IT WAS A HORRIBLE MOMENT
p363_206 THE TRAINING WILL TAKE PLACE IN DOWNING STREET
p363_209 THIS IS REALLY GOOD NEWS FOR US
p363_233 ALL WERE LATER ALLOWED HOME
p363_237 BY THEN IT WAS TOO LATE
p363_239 I'M SO LOOKING FORWARD TO IT
p363_242 IT WAS AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE
p363_245 I HAVE NOT HAD MUCH OF HIM
p363_250 THE GOALS WILL COME
p363_266 TWO OTHER MEN HAVE RECOVERED
p363_276 CAN YOU BELIEVE IT
p363_277 HE IS CERTAINLY NOT LOOKING FOR ANOTHER JOB
p363_282 OTHER PEOPLE HAD LOOKED AT IT
p363_283 AND THE OTHER WINNERS ARE
p363_296 IT WILL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
p363_306 IT IS NOT JUST IN EDINBURGH
p363_307 IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE
p363_312 HIS REMIT IS SPECIFIC
p363_320 MY VIEW HAS NOW COMPLETELY CHANGED
p363_324 HE WAS IN A MOOD
p363_325 WAS THIS ELEMENT ALWAYS THERE
p363_327 HE WAS THE ARCHITECT
p363_328 THE UNITED NATIONS MUST ACT
p363_331 I THINK THEY ARE RIGHT TO BE IMPATIENT
p363_334 THE BOARD IS CURRENTLY RESOLVING ITS DIFFERENCES
p363_339 I AM FEELING ON TOP OF THE WORLD
p363_345 ONE WAS TAKEN TO HOSPITAL
p363_347 GRITTY HE DID NOT WANT
p363_350 SURELY THE ANSWER IS YES
p363_360 WE'RE GOING TO SLEEP
p363_370 AND THERE ARE OTHERS
p363_371 HOWEVER IT WAS WELL WORTH THE WAIT
p363_375 JUST LOOK AT HIS RECORD
p363_377 IT IS A MEMORIAL
p363_383 IT WAS A DOUBLE TRAGEDY FOR THE FAMILY
p363_385 DOES IT REALLY MATTER
p363_386 I LOVED IT - AND SO DID MY FRIEND
p363_387 A DECISION IS EXPECTED TODAY
p363_392 IT HAS BEEN A MASSIVE SUCCESS
p363_407 THERE'S NOTHING SHE CAN'T DO
p363_413 THAT WAS REALLY TOUGH
p363_415 I AM HAPPY WITH MY FORM
p363_421 IT COULD HAVE TAKEN ANOTHER TWO MONTHS
p364_001 PLEASE CALL STELLA
p364_002 ASK HER TO BRING THESE THINGS WITH HER FROM THE STORE
p364_008 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
p364_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p364_022 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
p364_028 I LOVE YOU SO VERY MUCH
p364_033 WE'RE NOT EITHER OF THOSE THINGS
p364_035 IT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM
p364_044 THAT IS HOW THE FARMER IS FEELING TODAY
p364_046 SO WHAT DID HE DO
p364_050 WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY SAID
p364_054 THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT
p364_058 THAT'S WHERE IT ALL STARTED
p364_059 THE FAMILY IS SO HAPPY FOR HIM
p364_062 YOU MAKE THE CHOICE
p364_065 IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK
p364_067 PERHAPS IT WAS HER DEMEANOUR
p364_069 IT LASTED LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT
p364_074 THIS WAS A MASSIVE RESULT FOR US
p364_085 HE DISMISSED THE ACTION
p364_086 I SAID HOW MUCH
p364_105 THIS IS A HORRIBLE LOSS
p364_113 IT WAS JUST GREAT
p364_119 I WILL BE TRYING TO DO BETTER TOMORROW
p364_120 WHO WILL TAKE THEM AFTER THAT
p364_128 THIS TIME IT WAS NOT BE
p364_133 HE WILL BE FINE
p364_138 IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT
p364_140 IT WON THE MATCH
p364_142 I'D NEVER HAVE CALLED A DOCTOR FOR MYSELF
p364_143 IT IS SPONSORED BY THE HERALD
p364_150 DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM
p364_152 IT IS AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE
p364_157 HE DESERVED THAT MUCH
p364_161 IT IS NOT ILLEGAL
p364_164 I DON'T WANT TO USE THE TERM
p364_165 I REALLY FEEL SORRY FOR THE IRISH
p364_171 YOU WILL NEVER REPLACE THE CHILD
p364_172 WE MUST DO THAT
p364_176 I LEARNED THAT ONLY YESTERDAY
p364_184 SO IT WAS IN POLITICS
p364_197 THE HEARING CONTINUES TODAY
p364_205 IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL
p364_217 IT'S HAPPENED BUT IT'S A DREAM
p364_218 I HAD A SON
p364_240 IT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM
p364_241 THAT IS OUR BUSINESS
p364_243 THE CAR DRIVER WAS NOT INJURED
p364_245 COLIN CAMERON WAS EXCELLENT
p364_250 WE JUST NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO ACT
p364_251 IT WAS REALLY SURPRISING
p364_263 I'VE SEEN IT WORK ALREADY
p364_273 IT'S GREAT FUN TO GET TO ACT
p364_280 WE HAVE TO GET ON WITH IT
p364_287 IT DOES AND IT DOESN'T
p364_293 I KNOW WE ASK A LOT OF YOU
p364_297 IT WAS JUST ONE MAN
p364_298 IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH
p364_300 I REALLY WANT TO WIN IN GLASGOW
p364_306 SUB NOT USED MCKEE
p364_308 THEY WERE VERY RESPONSIVE
p374_003 SIX SPOONS OF FRESH SNOW PEAS FIVE THICK SLABS OF BLUE CHEESE AND MAYBE A SNACK FOR HER BROTHER BOB
p374_004 WE ALSO NEED A SMALL PLASTIC SNAKE AND A BIG TOY FROG FOR THE KIDS
p374_010 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
p374_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p374_028 WE DID IT IN ONE TAKE
p374_030 AND THAT WAS JUST FOR STARTERS
p374_033 I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER THE HORRIBLE IMAGES
p374_040 I'VE HAD A BALL
p374_047 I AM INCLINED TO PLAY IT DOWN
p374_054 BUT THE COST TO HIS HEALTH WAS ENORMOUS
p374_059 I CANNOT BELIEVE SHE HAS BEEN ADMONISHED
p374_063 NOBODY DID IN THOSE DAYS
p374_065 WHERE IS THE DISCIPLINE
p374_068 THIS TIME IT IS OFFICIAL
p374_070 SHE COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN KILLED
p374_073 WE'RE JUST A FAMILY WORKING HARD WORKING SEVEN DAYS A WEEK
p374_074 THAT MONEY COULD HAVE BEEN COMING TO SCOTLAND
p374_085 HIS TRACK RECORD IS NOT PROMISING
p374_086 EDINBURGH IN FACT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SURVEY
p374_088 NOW IT HAS BEEN ECLIPSED
p374_092 IT'S NOT RIGHT OF LABOUR
p374_093 IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK THAT WAY
p374_096 I'M WORKING AT THE MOMENT
p374_104 SADLY IT TOOK A TRAGEDY TO CHANGE THINGS
p374_107 WE'RE ALL PAYING FOR IT
p374_109 OF COURSE WE KNOW THEM FROM THEIR WORK IN THE THEATRE
p374_111 WE WERE NEVER TOLD IT WAS ALREADY DECIDED
p374_115 THEY HAVE JUST GOT TO BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES
p374_123 PITT OF COURSE WOULD PLAY THE LEAD SINGER
p374_124 IT IS TOO EARLY TO SPECULATE
p374_128 WE ARE VERY PLEASED
p374_150 NEWS OF THE FUNDING WAS BROADLY WELCOMED YESTERDAY
p374_156 MY WIFE IS TOTALLY BEHIND ME ON THIS
p374_160 AND SOONER THAN WE MAY THINK
p374_161 IT IS A STEP UP
p374_162 YOU PROBABLY HAVE NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE
p374_167 I'D NEVER GIVEN UP ON MYSELF
p374_170 LITTLE GIRLS ARE HIS VICTIMS
p374_171 IT IS NOT FOR ME THOUGH
p374_172 COUNCILLOR GORDON HAS REFUSED TO STAND DOWN
p374_181 I WAS DOING WELL AT THE HUSTINGS
p374_193 THE WINNER WILL BE ANNOUNCED BY EARLY SUMMER
p374_194 THIS IS THE NEW EDINBURGH
p374_201 THIS HASN'T HAPPENED IN A VACUUM
p374_202 I FOOLISHLY HAD DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT
p374_206 THEY HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH
p374_210 IT WAS AN ODD AFFAIR IN MANY RESPECTS
p374_215 I'M REALLY PROUD OF MY YOUNG PLAYERS
p374_220 THIS IS NOT A EUROPEAN ARMY
p374_221 NOT SO HE INSISTED
p374_224 DOES A LOT OF DRAWING
p374_226 THERE ARE MOMENTS OF HONESTY TOO
p374_230 WE USED TO KEEP OUR BUSINESS RATES
p374_232 WE NEED TO THINK
p374_235 FOR ONCE IT WASN'T ABOUT MONEY
p374_239 THEN IT WAS THE TURN OF THE CARNIVAL
p374_245 IT IS JUST SO SAD
p374_248 IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE CHANCELLOR
p374_251 IT WAS NOT PRETTY
p374_252 IT WAS LIKE A SCENE FROM THE HOLOCAUST
p374_269 WE DON'T NEED TO CHANGE THE LAW
p374_276 IT IS OUR OTHER HOME
p374_280 I AM ALSO DELIGHTED FOR ALL THE PLAYERS
p374_289 PERHAPS WE SHOULD DO THE SAME
p374_307 BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY FOR ANOTHER DAY
p374_311 IT WAS JUST AWFUL
p374_323 IT REALLY IS GOOD TO BE BACK
p374_332 HARROWING IS EASY AFTER ALL
p374_337 THAT IS THE FACT OF THE MATTER
p374_345 I HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH MY FORM
p374_346 THAT WAS ABOUT IT
p374_349 BY HARD WORK IS THE ANSWER
p374_354 CLARK IS BACK ON TOP FORM
p374_359 IT'S A GOOD START
p374_368 IT IS A MATTER FOR WESTMINSTER
p374_371 SPORT IS GOOD FOR YOU
p374_375 THE MOOD WAS EUPHORIC
p374_389 IT WAS GOOD TODAY
p374_391 THE HOTEL WAS HUGE
p374_394 WELL YOU CAN HAVE A TREE
p374_397 YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH
p374_401 OR SO IT SEEMED
p374_406 WE NEED TO CHAT
p374_407 WE ARE OBVIOUSLY DISTURBED BY THIS CASE
p374_416 THAT CLEARLY WASN'T WHAT THEY WANTED
p376_011 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
p376_014 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
p376_018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
p376_020 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
p376_021 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
p376_023 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
p376_037 HE HAS NOT BEEN NAMED
p376_040 IT WAS CLEAR
p376_049 A RECORDING CONTRACT IS ON THE HORIZON
p376_058 THIS IS A STEP BACKWARDS
p376_063 ART IS EXTRA
p376_065 AN APPEAL AGAINST THE SENTENCE WAS DISMISSED THE FOLLOWING YEAR
p376_079 OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY WERE TOO UPSET TO COMMENT LAST NIGHT
p376_093 SCOTLAND WILL HAVE STRONG DEFENCES AS PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
p376_094 THE SELECTION PROCESS IS STILL AT A VERY EARLY STAGE
p376_109 BUT THE FANS DESERVE TO KNOW
p376_121 SO THE EUROPEAN ELECTIONS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
p376_132 IT'S NOT TRUE
p376_142 IS THAT TITANIC
p376_143 I WAS AWFUL
p376_144 THE IDEA IS SIMPLE
p376_148 THEY DID VERY WELL
p376_149 THE PETITION WAS FORMALLY PRESENTED AT DOWNING STREET YESTERDAY
p376_151 THE WEAKNESSES ARE FEW
p376_153 IT WAS DEPLOYED IN THE GULF WAR
p376_164 COUNCILLORS ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE A DECISION WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS
p376_165 MILITARY ACTION IS THE ONLY OPTION WE HAVE ON THE TABLE TODAY
p376_169 YOU HAD TO GO AND SEE HIM
p376_180 I HAVE NO SYMPATHY WITH HER AT ALL
p376_182 MILLER WAS EVERY BIT AS HAPPY
p376_185 WHAT HAS CAUSED THE DEMISE OF SINGING
p376_188 SUDDENLY THE RUGBY WORLD HAD CHANGED
p376_190 LAST NIGHT WAS A KEY EPISODE
p376_193 THE MODERN APPROACH WILL ALSO BE REFLECTED IN THE TERMS OF ADDRESS
p376_203 I DON'T WANT TO USE IT
p376_204 HARRY POTTER HAS LOST HIS MAGIC
p376_205 THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR ROLE
p376_206 I HAD RELIED ON HIM
p376_207 I BEGAN TO PRAY
p376_215 THAT HAS BEEN THE EASY PART
p376_217 CLEARLY THE STAKES ARE HIGH
p376_224 WE'RE LOOKING FOR JUSTICE
p376_230 IT'S VERY SAFE
p376_232 HOSPITALS ARE FOR THE ILL
p376_237 YOU CAN FEEL AT HOME IN CHINA
p376_240 IT IS A POLICY WHICH HAS THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE MINISTER
p376_245 WE HAVE GOT NO MONEY TO GO ANYWHERE
p376_246 I WATCHED A GAME
p376_252 THIS COURT HAS MADE AN ORDER WHICH HAS NOT BEEN OBSERVED
p376_254 IT'S ALL CHANGE ON THE MUSIC SCENE IN MANCHESTER
p376_260 HE WAS POPULAR
p376_261 IMMEDIATE ACTION MUST BE TAKEN
p376_263 SIMILAR MEASURES ARE EXPECTED IN ENGLAND AND WALES
p376_277 YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE BOTH SIDES
p376_287 THAT COULD CHANGE
p376_288 HE SHOULD HAVE WON
p376_290 A NEW SCHOOL WILL BE BUILT
p376_294 HE HAS RETIRED
p376_295 IT BECAME A BOOK BY ITSELF
