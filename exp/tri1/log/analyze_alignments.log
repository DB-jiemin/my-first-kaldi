The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 43.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 57.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 2.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 34.5 hours of data, or 19.5 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 1.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (9,16.8,47)
