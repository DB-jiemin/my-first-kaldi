The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 44.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 57.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 3.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 8.7 hours of data, or 4.8 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 0.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (23,33.5,91)
